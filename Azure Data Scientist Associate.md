# Explore and configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace
## Explore Azure Machine Learning workspace resources and assets
### Introduction

As a data scientist, you want to focus on training machine learning models. Ideally, you want to work with a service that gives you access to all the necessary infrastructure you need to train and deploy a model. You also want the service to allow you to track any work you do to make your model reproducible and robust.

Azure Machine Learning provides a platform for data scientists to train, deploy, and manage their machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure platform. Azure Machine Learning provides a comprehensive set of **resources** and **assets** to train and deploy effective machine learning models.

To use these resources and assets, you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace resource in your Azure subscription. In the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can manage data, compute resources, models, endpoints, and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads.
### Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

To get access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you first need to create the **Azure Machine Learning** service in your Azure subscription. The **workspace** is central place where you can work with all resources and assets available to train and deploy machine learning models. For reproducibility, the workspace stores a history of all training jobs, including logs, metrics, outputs, and a snapshot of your code.

#### Understand the Azure Machine Learning service

To create an Azure Machine Learning service, you have to:

1. Get access to **Azure**, for example through the Azure portal.
2. Sign in to get access to an **Azure subscription**.
3. Create a **resource group** within your subscription.
4. Create an **Azure Machine Learning service** to create a workspace.

When a workspace is provisioned, Azure automatically creates other Azure resources within the same resource group to support the workspace:

1. **Azure Storage Account**: To store files and notebooks used in the workspace, and to store metadata of jobs and models.
2. **Azure Key Vault**: To securely manage secrets such as authentication keys and credentials used by the workspace.
3. **Application Insights**: To monitor predictive services in the workspace.
4. **Azure Container Registry**: Created when needed to store images for Azure Machine Learning environments.

![Diagram of hierarchy of Azure resources needed for the Azure Machine Learning workspace.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace-resources-assets/media/overview-azure-resources.png)

##### Create the workspace

You can create an Azure Machine Learning workspace in any of the following ways:

- Use the user interface in the **Azure portal** to create an Azure Machine Learning service.
- Create an **Azure Resource Manager** (**ARM**) template. [Learn how to use an ARM template to create a workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-workspace-template?tabs=azcli%3Fazure-portal%3Dtrue).
- Use the **Azure Command Line Interface** (**CLI**) with the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension. [Learn how to create the workspace with the CLI v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-machine-learning-resources-cli-v2/).
- Use the **Azure Machine Learning Python SDK**.

For example, the following code uses the Python SDK to create a workspace named `mlw-example`:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Workspace

workspace_name = "mlw-example"

ws_basic = Workspace(
    name=workspace_name,
    location="eastus",
    display_name="Basic workspace-example",
    description="This example shows how to create a basic workspace",
)
ml_client.workspaces.begin_create(ws_basic)
```

#### Explore the workspace in the Azure portal

Creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace typically takes between 5-10 minutes to complete. When your workspace is created, you can select the workspace to view its details.

![Screenshot of the overview page of the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace-resources-assets/media/workspace-portal.png)

From the **Overview** page of the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal, you can launch the Azure Machine Learning studio. The Azure Machine Learning studio is a web portal and provides an easy-to-use interface to create, manage, and use resources and assets in the workspace.

From the Azure portal, you can also give others access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace, using the **Access control**.

#### Give access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace

You can give individual users or teams access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Access is granted in Azure using **role-based access control** (**RBAC**), which you can configure in the **Access control** tab of the resource or resource group.

In the access control tab, you can manage permissions to restrict what actions certain users or teams can perform. For example, you could create a policy that only allows users in the _Azure administrators group_ to create compute targets and datastores. While users in the _data scientists group_ can create and run jobs to train models, and register models.

There are three general built-in roles that you can use across resources and resource groups to assign permissions to other users:

- **Owner**: Gets full access to all resources, and can grant access to others using access control.
- **Contributor**: Gets full access to all resources, but can't grant access to others.
- **Reader**: Can only view the resource, but isn't allowed to make any changes.

Additionally, Azure Machine Learning has specific built-in roles you can use:

- **AzureML Data Scientist**: Can perform all actions within the workspace, except for creating or deleting compute resources, or editing the workspace settings.
- **AzureML Compute Operator**: Is allowed to create, change, and manage access the compute resources within a workspace.

Finally, if the built-in roles aren't meeting your needs, you can create a custom role to assign permissions to other users.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including creating custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-assign-roles).

#### Organize your workspaces

Initially, you might only work with one workspace. However, when working on large-scale projects, you might choose to use multiple workspaces.

You can use workspaces to group machine learning assets based on projects, deployment environments (for example, test and production), teams, or some other organizing principle.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to organize Azure Machine Learning workspaces for an enterprise environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-resource-organization).

### Identify Azure Machine Learning resources

**Resources** in Azure Machine Learning refer to the infrastructure you need to run a machine learning workflow. Ideally, you want someone like an administrator to create and manage the resources.

The resources in Azure Machine Learning include:

- The workspace
- Compute resources
- Datastores

#### Create and manage the workspace

The **workspace** is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning. Data scientists need access to the workspace to train and track models, and to deploy the models to endpoints.

However, you want to be careful with who has _full_ access to the workspace. Next to references to compute resources and datastores, you can find all logs, metrics, outputs, models, and snapshots of your code in the workspace.

#### Create and manage compute resources

One of the most important resources you need when training or deploying a model is **compute**. There are five types of compute in the Azure Machine Learning workspace:

- **Compute instances**: Similar to a virtual machine in the cloud, managed by the workspace. Ideal to use as a development environment to run (Jupyter) notebooks.
- **Compute clusters**: On-demand clusters of CPU or GPU compute nodes in the cloud, managed by the workspace. Ideal to use for production workloads as they automatically scale to your needs.
- **Kubernetes clusters**: Allows you to create or attach an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Ideal to deploy trained machine learning models in production scenarios.
- **Attached computes**: Allows you to attach other Azure compute resources to the workspace, like Azure Databricks or Synapse Spark pools.
- **Serverless compute**: A fully managed, on-demand compute you can use for training jobs.

>**Note**: As Azure Machine Learning creates and manages _serverless compute_ for you, it's not listed on the compute page in the studio. Learn more about how to [use serverless compute for model training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-serverless-compute)

Though compute is the most important resource when working with machine learning workloads, it can also be the most cost-intensive. Therefore, a best practice is to only allow administrators to create and manage compute resources. Data scientists shouldn't be allowed to edit compute, but only use the available compute to run their workloads.

#### Create and manage datastores

The workspace doesn't store any data itself. Instead, all data is stored in **datastores**, which are references to Azure data services. The connection information to a data service that a datastore represents, is stored in the Azure Key Vault.

When a workspace is created, an Azure Storage account is created and automatically connected to the workspace. As a result, you have four datastores already added to your workspace:

- `workspaceartifactstore`: Connects to the `azureml` container of the Azure Storage account created with the workspace. Used to store compute and experiment logs when running jobs.
- `workspaceworkingdirectory`: Connects to the file share of the Azure Storage account created with the workspace used by the **Notebooks** section of the studio. Whenever you upload files or folders to access from a compute instance, the files or folders are uploaded to this file share.
- `workspaceblobstore`: Connects to the Blob Storage of the Azure Storage account created with the workspace. Specifically the `azureml-blobstore-...` container. Set as the default datastore, which means that whenever you create a data asset and upload data, you store the data in this container.
- `workspacefilestore`: Connects to the file share of the Azure Storage account created with the workspace. Specifically the `azureml-filestore-...` file share.

Additionally, you can create datastores to connect to other Azure data services. Most commonly, your datastores connects to an Azure Storage Account or Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2) as those data services are most often used in data science projects.


### Identify Azure Machine Learning assets

As a data scientist, you mostly work with **assets** in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Assets are created and used at various stages of a project and include:

- Models
- Environments
- Data
- Components

#### Create and manage models

The end product of training a model is the model itself. You can train machine learning models with various frameworks, like Scikit-learn or PyTorch. A common way to store such models is to package the model as a Python pickle file (`.pkl` extension).

Alternatively, you can use the open-source platform MLflow to store your model in the MLModel format.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [logging workflow artifacts as models using MLflow and the MLModel format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow-models).

Whatever format you choose, binary files represent the model and any corresponding metadata. To persist those files, you can create or register a model in the workspace.

When you create a **model** in the workspace, you specify the _name_ and _version_. Especially useful when you deploy the registered model, versioning allows you to track the specific model you want to use.

#### Create and manage environments

When you work with cloud compute, it's important to ensure that your code runs on any compute that is available to you. Whether you want to run a script on a compute instance, or a compute cluster, the code should execute successfully.

Imagine working in Python or R, using open-source frameworks to train a model, on your local device. If you want to use a library such as Scikit-learn or PyTorch, you have to install it on your device.

Similarly, when you write code that uses any frameworks or libraries, you need to ensure the necessary dependencies are installed on the compute that executes the code. To list all necessary requirements, you can create **environments**. When you create an environment, you have to specify the _name_ and _version_.

Environments specify software packages, environment variables, and software settings to run scripts. An environment is stored as an image in the Azure Container Registry created with the workspace when it's used for the first time.

Whenever you want to run a script, you can specify the environment that needs to be used by the compute target. The environment installs all necessary requirements on the compute before executing the script, making your code robust and reusable across compute targets.

#### Create and manage data

Whereas datastores contain the connection information to Azure data storage services, **data assets** refer to a specific file or folder.

You can use data assets to easily access data every time, without having to provide authentication every time you want to access it.

When you create a data asset in the workspace, you specify the path to point to the file or folder, and the _name_ and _version_.

#### Create and manage components

To train machine learning models, you write code. Across projects, there can be code you can reuse. Instead of writing code from scratch, you want to reuse snippets of code from other projects.

To make it easier to share code, you can create a **component** in a workspace. To create a component, you have to specify the _name_, _version_, code, and _environment_ needed to run the code.

You can use components when creating **pipelines**. A component therefore often represents a step in a pipeline, for example to normalize data, to train a regression model, or to test the trained model on a validation dataset.

### Train models in the workspace

To train models with the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you have several options:

- Use **Automated Machine Learning**.
- Run a Jupyter notebook.
- Run a script as a job.

#### Explore algorithms and hyperparameter values with Automated Machine Learning

When you have a training dataset and you're tasked with finding the best performing model, you might want to experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameter values.

Manually experimenting with different configurations to train a model might take long. Alternatively, you can use Automated Machine Learning to speed up the process.

Automated Machine Learning iterates through algorithms paired with feature selections to find the best performing model for your data.

![Screenshot of a task selection when configuring Automated Machine Learning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace-resources-assets/media/automated-machine-learning.png)

#### Run a notebook

When you prefer to develop by running code in notebooks, you can use the built-in notebook feature in the workspace.

The **Notebooks** page in the studio allows you to edit and run Jupyter notebooks.

![Screenshot of an open notebook in the Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace-resources-assets/media/notebooks.png)

All files you clone or create in the notebooks section are stored in the file share of the Azure Storage account created with the workspace.

To run notebooks, you use a compute instance as they're ideal for development and work similar to a virtual machine.

You can also choose to edit and run notebooks in Visual Studio Code, while still using a compute instance to run the notebooks.

#### Run a script as a job

When you want to prepare your code to be production ready, it's better to use scripts. You can easily automate the execution of script to automate any machine learning workload.

You can run a script as a **job** in Azure Machine Learning. When you submit a job to the workspace, all inputs and outputs are stored in the workspace.

![Screenshot of the overview of a command job showing the properties, inputs, and outputs.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace-resources-assets/media/job-overview.png)

There are different types of jobs depending on how you want to execute a workload:

- **Command**: Execute a single script.
- **Sweep**: Perform hyperparameter tuning when executing a single script.
- **Pipeline**: Run a pipeline consisting of multiple scripts or components.

>**Note**: When you submit a pipeline you created with the designer it will run as a pipeline job. When you submit an Automated Machine Learning experiment, it will also run as a job.

### Explore the Azure Machine Learning workspace

Azure Machine Learning provides a data science platform to train and manage machine learning models. In this lab, you’ll create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and explore the various ways to work with the workspace. The lab is designed as an introduction of the various core capabilities of Azure Machine Learning and the developer tools. If you want to learn about the capabilities in more depth, there are other labs to explore.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning **workspace** provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can provision a workspace using the interactive interface in the Azure portal, or you can use the Azure CLI with the Azure Machine Learning extension. In most production scenarios, it’s best to automate provisioning with the CLI so that you can incorporate resource deployment into a repeatable development and operations (_DevOps_) process.

In this exercise, you’ll use the Azure portal to provision Azure Machine Learning to explore all options.

1. Sign into the `https://portal.azure.com/`.
2. Create a new **Azure Machine Learning** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: `rg-dp100-labs`
    - **Workspace name**: `mlw-dp100-labs`
    - **Region**: _Select the geographical region closest to you_
    - **Storage account**: _Note the default new storage account that will be created for your workspace_
    - **Key vault**: _Note the default new key vault that will be created for your workspace_
    - **Application insights**: _Note the default new application insights resource that will be created for your workspace_
    - **Container registry**: None (_one will be created automatically the first time you deploy a model to a container_)
3. Wait for the workspace and its associated resources to be created - this typically takes around 5 minutes.

> **Note**: When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use some advanced options to restrict access through a _private endpoint_ and specify custom keys for data encryption. We won’t use these options in this exercise - but you should be aware of them!

#### Explore the Azure Machine Learning studio

_Azure Machine Learning studio_ is a web-based portal through which you can access the Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can use the Azure Machine Learning studio to manage all assets and resources within your workspace.

1. Go to the resource group named **rg-dp100-labs**.
2. Confirm that the resource group contains your Azure Machine Learning workspace, an Application Insights, a Key Vault, and a Storage Account.
3. Select your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
4. Select **Launch studio** from the **Overview** page. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
5. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
6. Note the different pages shown on the left side of the studio. If only the symbols are visible in the menu, select the ☰ icon to expand the menu and explore the names of the pages.
7. Note the **Authoring** section, which includes **Notebooks**, **Automated ML**, and **Designer**. These are the three ways you can create your own machine learning models within the Azure Machine Learning studio.
8. Note the **Assets** section, which includes **Data**, **Jobs**, and **Models** among other things. Assets are either consumed or created when training or scoring a model. Assets are used to train, deploy, and manage your models and can be versioned to keep track of your history.
9. Note the **Manage** section, which includes **Compute** among other things. These are infrastructural resources needed to train or deploy a machine learning model.

#### Train a model using AutoML

To explore the use of the assets and resources in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, let’s try and train a model.

A quick way to train and find the best model for a task based on your data is by using the **AutoML** option.

> **Note**: Pop-ups may appear throughout to guide you through the studio. You can close and ignore all pop-ups and focus on the instructions of this lab.

1. Download the training data that will be used at `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml/raw/refs/heads/main/Labs/02/diabetes-data.zip` and extract the compressed files.
2. Back in the Azure Machine Learning studio, select the **AutoML** page from the menu on the left side of the studio.
3. Select **+ New Automated ML job**.
4. In the **Basic settings** step, give a unique name to your training job and experiment or use the default values assigned. Select **Next**.
5. In the **Task type & data** step, select **Classification** as the task type, and select **+ Create** to add your training data.
6. On the **Create data asset** page, in the **Data type** step, give a name to your data asset (e.g `training-data`) and select **Next**.
7. In the **Data source** step, select **From local files** to upload the training data you download previously. Select **Next**.
8. In the **Destination storage type** step, verify that **Azure Blob Storage** is selected as the datastore type and that **workspaceblobstore** is the datastore selected. Select **Next**.
9. In the **MLTable selection** step, select **Upload folder** and select the folder you extracted from the compressed file downloaded earlier. Select **Next**.
10. Review the settings for your data asset and select **Create**.
11. Back in the **Task type & data** step, select the data you just uploaded and select **Next**.

> **Tip**: You may need to select the **Classification** task type again before moving to the next step.

12. In the **Task settings** step, select **Diabetic (Boolean)** as your target column, then open the **View additional configuration settings** option.
13. In the **Additional configuration** pane, change the primary metric to **Accuracy**, then select **Save**.
14. Expand the **Limits** option and set the following properties:
    - **Max trials**: 10
    - **Experiment timeout (minutes)**: 60
    - **Iteration timeout (minutes)**: 15
    - **Enable early termination**: Checked
15. For **Test data**, select **Train-test split** and verify that the **Percentage test of data** is 10. Select **Next**.
16. In the **Compute** step, verify that the compute type is **Serveless** and the virtual machine size selected is **Standard_DS3_v2**. Select **Next**.

> **Note**: Compute instances and clusters are based on standard Azure virtual machine images. For this exercise, the _Standard_DS3_v2_ image is recommended to achieve the optimal balance of cost and performance. If your subscription has a quota that does not include this image, choose an alternative image; but bear in mind that a larger image may incur higher cost and a smaller image may not be sufficient to complete the tasks. Alternatively, ask your Azure administrator to extend your quota.

17. Review all your settings and select **Submit training job**.

#### Use jobs to view your history

After submitting the job, you’ll be redirected to the job’s page. Jobs allow you to keep track of the workloads you ran and compare them with each other. Jobs belong to an **experiment**, which allows you to group job runs together.

1. Note that in the **Overview** parameters, you can find the job’s status, who created it, when it was created and how long it took to run (among other things).
2. It should take 10-20 minutes for the training job to finish. When it is completed, you can also view the details of each individual component run, including the output. Feel free to explore the job page to understand how the models are trained.
    
    Azure Machine Learning automatically keeps track of your job’s properties. By using jobs, you can easily view your history to understand what you or your colleagues have already done. During experimentation, jobs help keep track of the different models you train to compare and identify the best model. During production, jobs allow you to check whether automated workloads ran as expected.
    

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-labs** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Explore developer tools for workspace interaction
### Introduction

Azure Machine Learning provides data scientists with several resources and assets to build and manage machine learning models.

You can create and manage resources and assets by using various tools that interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Though you can use any tool to perform the same tasks, each tool provides advantages and disadvantages for specific workloads. You can choose which tool or developer approach best fits your needs.

>**Important**: Azure Machine Learning has introduced version 2 (v2) to introduce a consistency of features and terminology across interfaces. You should use v2 if you're starting a new machine learning project. Therefore, this module only covers v2. Learn more about [deciding between v1 and v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-migrate-from-v1).

### Explore the studio

The easiest and most intuitive way to interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace, is by using the **studio**.

The Azure Machine Learning studio is a web portal, which provides an overview of all resources and assets available in the workspace.

#### Access the studio

After you've created an Azure Machine Learning workspace, there are two common ways to access the Azure Machine Learning studio:

- Launch the studio from the **Overview** page of the Azure Machine Learning workspace resource in the Azure portal.
- Navigate to the studio directly by signing in at [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com/) using the credentials associated with your Azure subscription.

When you've opened your workspace in the Azure Machine Learning studio, a menu appears in the sidebar.

![Diagram of different hyperparameter values resulting in different models by performing hyperparameter tuning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-developer-tools-for-workspace-interaction/media/studio-home.png)

The menu shows what you can do in the studio:

- **Author**: Create new jobs to train and track a machine learning model.
- **Assets**: Create and review assets you use when training models.
- **Manage**: Create and manage resources you need to train models.

Though you can use each tool at any time, the studio is ideal for quick experimentation or when you want to explore your past jobs.

For example, use the studio if you want to verify that your pipeline ran successfully. Or when a pipeline job has failed, you can use the studio to navigate to the logs and review the error messages.

For more repetitive work, or tasks that you'd like to automate, the Azure CLI or Python SDK are better suited as these tools allow you to define your work in code.

### Explore the Python SDK

>**Important**: Currently, there are two versions of the Python SDK: version 1 (v1) and version 2 (v2). For any new projects, you should use v2 and therefore, **the content in this unit only covers v2**. Learn more about [deciding between v1 and v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-migrate-from-v1).

Data scientists can use Azure Machine Learning to train, track, and manage machine learning models. As a data scientist, you'll mostly work with the assets within the Azure Machine Learning workspace for your machine learning workloads.

As most data scientists are familiar with Python, Azure Machine Learning offers a software development kit (SDK) so that you can interact with the workspace using Python.

The Python SDK for Azure Machine Learning is an ideal tool for data scientists that can be used in any Python environment. Whether you normally work with Jupyter notebooks, Visual Studio Code, you can install the Python SDK and connect to the workspace.

#### Install the Python SDK

To install the Python SDK within your Python environment, you need Python 3.7 or later. You can install the package with `pip`:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-ml
```

>**Note**: When working with notebooks within the Azure Machine Learning studio, the new Python SDK is already installed when using Python 3.10 or later. You can use the Python SDK v2 with earlier versions of Python, but you'll have to install it first.

#### Connect to the workspace

After the Python SDK is installed, you'll need to connect to the workspace. By connecting, you're authenticating your environment to interact with the workspace to create and manage assets and resources.

To authenticate, you need the values to three necessary parameters:

- `subscription_id`: Your subscription ID.
- `resource_group`: The name of your resource group.
- `workspace_name`: The name of your workspace.

Next, you can define the authentication by using the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

ml_client = MLClient(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace
)
```

After defining the authentication, you need to call `MLClient` for the environment to connect to the workspace. You'll call `MLClient` anytime you want to create or update an asset or resource in the workspace.

For example, you'll connect to the workspace when you create a new job to train a model:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    experiment_name="train-model"
)

# connect to workspace and submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
```

#### Use the reference documentation

To efficiently work with the Python SDK, you'll need to use the reference documentation. In the reference documentation, you'll find all possible classes, methods, and parameters available within the Python SDK.

[The reference documentation on the `MLClient` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.mlclient) includes the methods you can use to connect and interact with the workspace. Moreover, it also links to the possible operations for the various entities like how to list the existing datastores in your workspace.

[The reference documentation also includes a list of the classes for all entities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities) you can interact with. For example, separate classes exist when you want to create a datastore that links to an Azure Blob Storage, or to an Azure Data Lake Gen 2.

By selecting a specific class like `AmlCompute` from the list of entities, you can find [a more detailed page on how to use the class and what parameters it accepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.amlcompute).

### Explore the CLI

>I**mportant**: **The content in this unit only covers version 2 of the CLI**. Learn more about [deciding between version 1 and 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-migrate-from-v1).

Another code-based approach to interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace is the command-line interface (CLI). As a data scientist, you may not work with the CLI as much as you do with Python. The Azure CLI is commonly used by administrators and engineers to automate tasks in Azure.

There are many advantages to using the Azure CLI with Azure Machine Learning. The Azure CLI allows you to:

- Automate the creation and configuration of assets and resources to make it **repeatable**.
- Ensure **consistency** for assets and resources that must be replicated in multiple environments (for example, development, test, and production).
- Incorporate machine learning asset configuration into developer operations (**DevOps**) **workflows**, such as **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment** (**CI/CD**) pipelines.

To interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace using the Azure CLI, you'll need to install the Azure CLI and the Azure Machine Learning extension.

#### Install the Azure CLI

You can install the Azure CLI on a Linux, Mac, or Windows computer. With the Azure CLI, you run commands or scripts to manage Azure resources. You can also use the Azure CLI from a browser through the Azure Cloud Shell. No matter which platform you choose, you can execute the same tasks. But, the installation of the Azure CLI, the commands, and scripts are different across platforms.

>**Important**: To install the Azure CLI on your computer you can use a package manager. Here are the instructions to [install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), based on the platform you choose. You don't need to install the Azure CLI if you use the Azure Cloud Shell. Learn more about how to use [the Azure Cloud Shell in this overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

#### Install the Azure Machine Learning extension

After you've installed the Azure CLI, or set up the Azure Cloud Shell, you need to install the Azure Machine Learning extension to manage Azure Machine Learning resources using the Azure CLI.

You can install the Azure Machine Learning extension `ml` with the following command:

```bash
az extension add -n ml -y
```

You can then run the help command `-h` to check that the extension is installed and to get a list of commands available with this extension. The list gives an overview of the tasks you can execute with the Azure CLI extension for Azure Machine Learning:

```bash
az ml -h
```

#### Work with the Azure CLI

To use the Azure CLI to interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you'll use **commands**. Each command is prefixed with `az ml`. You can find the [list of commands in the reference documentation of the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml).

For example, to create a compute target, you can use the following command:

```bash
az ml compute create --name aml-cluster --size STANDARD_DS3_v2 --min-instances 0 --max-instances 5 --type AmlCompute --resource-group my-resource-group --workspace-name my-workspace
```

To explore all possible parameters that you can use with a command, you can [review the reference documentation for the specific command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/compute).

As you define the parameters for an asset or resource you want to create, you may prefer using YAML files to define the configuration instead. When you store all parameter values in a YAML file, it becomes easier to organize and automate tasks.

For example, you can also create the same compute target by first defining the configuration in a YAML file:

```yml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/amlCompute.schema.json 
name: aml-cluster
type: amlcompute
size: STANDARD_DS3_v2
min_instances: 0
max_instances: 5
```

All possible parameters that you can include in the YAML file can be found in [the reference documentation for the specific asset or resource you want to create like a compute cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-compute-aml).

When you saved the YAML file as `compute.yml`, you can create the compute target with the following command:

```bash
az ml compute create --file compute.yml --resource-group my-resource-group --workspace-name my-workspace
```

You can find [an overview of all the YAML schemas in the reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-overview).

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to use the CLI (v2) with Azure Machine Learning to train models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/train-models-azure-machine-learning-cli-v2/).

### Explore developer tools for workspace interaction

You can use various tools to interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Depending on what task you need to perform and your preference for developer tool, you can choose which tool to use when. This lab is designed as an introduction to the developer tools commonly used for workspace interaction. If you want to learn how to use a specific tool in more depth, there are other labs to explore.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

The commonly used developer tools for interacting with the Azure Machine Learning workspace are:

- **Azure CLI** with the Azure Machine Learning extension: This command-line approach is ideal for the automation of infrastructure.
- **Azure Machine Learning studio**: Use the user-friendly UI to explore the workspace and all of its capabilities.
- **Python SDK** for Azure Machine Learning: Use to submit jobs and manage models from a Jupyter notebook, ideal for data scientists.

You’ll explore each of these tools for tasks that are commonly done with that tool.

#### Provision the infrastructure with the Azure CLI

For a data scientist to train a machine learning model with Azure Machine Learning, you’ll need to set up the necessary infrastructure. You can use the Azure CLI with the Azure Machine Learning extension to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and resources like a compute instance.

To start, open the Azure Cloud Shell, install the Azure Machine Learning extension and clone the Git repo.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. Remove any ML CLI extensions (both version 1 and 2) to avoid any conflicts with previous versions with this command:
    
    ```bash
     az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
     az extension remove -n ml
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
6. Install the Azure Machine Learning (v2) extension with the following command:
    
    ```bash
     az extension add -n ml -y
    ```
    
7. Create a resource group. Choose a location close to you.
    
    ```bash
     az group create --name "rg-dp100-labs" --location "eastus"
    ```
    
8. Create a workspace:
    
    ```bash
     az ml workspace create --name "mlw-dp100-labs" -g "rg-dp100-labs"
    ```
    
9. Wait for the workspace and its associated resources to be created - this typically takes around 5 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Create a compute instance with the Azure CLI

Another important part of the infrastructure needed to train a machine learning model is **compute**. Though you can train models locally, it’s more scalable and cost efficient to use cloud compute.

When data scientists are developing a machine learning model in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, they want to use a virtual machine on which they can run Jupyter notebooks. For development, a **compute instance** is an ideal fit.

After creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can also create a compute instance using the Azure CLI.

In this exercise, you’ll create a compute instance with the following settings:

- **Compute name**: _Name of compute instance. Has to be unique and fewer than 24 characters._
- **Virtual machine size**: STANDARD_DS11_V2
- **Compute type** (instance or cluster): ComputeInstance
- **Azure Machine Learning workspace name**: mlw-dp100-labs
- **Resource group**: rg-dp100-labs

1. Use the following command to create a compute instance in your workspace. If the compute instance name contains “XXXX”, replace it with random numbers to create a unique name.
    
    ```bash
     az ml compute create --name "ciXXXX" --size STANDARD_DS11_V2 --type ComputeInstance -w mlw-dp100-labs -g rg-dp100-labs
    ```
    
    If you get an error message that a compute instance with the name already exists, change the name and retry the command.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Compute creation error  
    

#### Create a compute cluster with the Azure CLI

Though a compute instance is ideal for development, a compute cluster is better suited when we want to train machine learning models. Only when a job is submitted to use the compute cluster, will it resize to more than 0 nodes and run the job. Once the compute cluster is no longer needed, it will automatically resize back to 0 nodes to minimize costs.

To create a compute cluster, you can use the Azure CLI, similar to creating a compute instance.

You’ll create a compute cluster with the following settings:

- **Compute name**: aml-cluster
- **Virtual machine size**: STANDARD_DS11_V2
- **Compute type**: AmlCompute _(Creates a compute cluster)_
- **Maximum instances**: _Maximum number of nodes_
- **Azure Machine Learning workspace name**: mlw-dp100-labs
- **Resource group**: rg-dp100-labs

1. Use the following command to create a compute cluster in your workspace.
    
    ```bash
     az ml compute create --name "aml-cluster" --size STANDARD_DS11_V2 --max-instances 2 --type AmlCompute -w mlw-dp100-labs -g rg-dp100-labs
    ```
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Compute creation error  
    

#### Configure your workstation with the Azure Machine Learning studio

Though the Azure CLI is ideal for automation, you may want to review the output of the commands you executed. You can use the Azure Machine Learning studio to check whether resources and assets have been created, and to check whether jobs ran successfully or review why a job failed.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-labs**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be in Succeeded state and have 0 nodes running.

#### Use the Python SDK to train a model

Now that you’ve verified that the necessary compute has been created, you can use the Python SDK to run a training script. You’ll install and use the Python SDK on the compute instance and train the machine learning model on the compute cluster.

1. In your **compute instance**, there are a number of options in the **Applications** field. Select the **Terminal** application to launch the terminal (you may need to click the ellipsis to expand the selection).
2. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages were not installed.
    
3. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
4. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, select **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.
5. Open the **Labs/02/Run training script.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
6. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel on the upper right corner of the notebook environment. Each kernel has its own image with its own set of packages pre-installed.
7. Run all cells in the notebook.

A new job will be created in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. The job tracks the inputs defined in the job configuration, the code used, and the outputs like metrics to evaluate the model.

#### Review your job history in the Azure Machine Learning studio

When you submit a job to the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can review its status in the Azure Machine Learning studio.

1. Either select the job URL provided as output in the notebook, or navigate to the **Jobs** page in the Azure Machine Learning studio.
2. A new experiment is listed named **diabetes-training**. Select the latest job **diabetes-pythonv2-train**.
3. Review the job’s **Properties**. Note the job **Status**:
    - **Queued**: The job is waiting for compute to become available.
    - **Preparing**: The compute cluster is resizing or the environment is being installed on the compute target.
    - **Running**: The training script is being executed.
    - **Finalizing**: The training script ran and the job is being updated with all final information.
    - **Completed**: The job successfully completed and is terminated.
    - **Failed**: The job failed and is terminated.
4. Under **Outputs + logs**, you’ll find the output of the script in **user_logs/std_log.txt**. Outputs from **print** statements in the script will show here. If there’s an error because of a problem with your script, you’ll find the error message here too.
5. Under **Code**, you’ll find the folder you specified in the job configuration. This folder includes the training script and dataset.

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-labs** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.


## Make data available in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

Data is a fundamental element in any machine learning workload. You need data to train a model and you create data when using a model to generate predictions.

To work with data in Azure Machine Learning, you can access data by using **Uniform Resource Identifiers** (**URIs**). When you work with a data source or a specific file or folder repeatedly, you can create **datastores** and **data assets** within the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Datastores and data assets allow you to securely store the connection information to your data.

### Understand URIs

You can store data on your local device, or somewhere in the cloud. Wherever you store your data, you want to access the data when training machine learning models. To find and access data in Azure Machine Learning, you can use **Uniform Resource Identifiers** (**URIs**).

#### Understand URIs

A URI references the location of your data. For Azure Machine Learning to connect to your data, you need to prefix the URI with the appropriate protocol. There are three common protocols when working with data in the context of Azure Machine Learning:

![Diagram of different types of protocols that Azure Machine Learning uses to connect to external data sources.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/make-data-available-azure-machine-learning/media/data.png)

- `http(s)`: Use for data stores publicly or privately in an Azure Blob Storage or publicly available http(s) location.
- `abfs(s)`: Use for data stores in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2.
- `azureml`: Use for data stored in a datastore.

For example, you may create an Azure Blob Storage in Azure. To store data, you create a container named `training-data`. Within the container, you create a folder `datastore-path`. Within the folder, you store the CSV file `diabetes.csv`.

![Screenshot of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/make-data-available-azure-machine-learning/media/blob-storage.png)

When you want to access the data from the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use the path to the folder or file directly. When you want to connect to the folder or file directly, you can use the `http(s)` protocol. If the container is set to private, you'll need to provide some kind of authentication to get access to the data, like a Shared Access Signature (SAS).

When you create a datastore in Azure Machine Learning, you'll store the connection and authentication information in the workspace. Then, to access the data in the container, you can use the `azureml` protocol.

>**Tip**: A datastore is a reference to an existing storage account on Azure. Therefore, when you refer to data stored in a datastore, you may be referring to data being stored in an Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage. When you refer to the datastore however, you won't need to authenticate as the connection information stored with the datastore will be used by Azure Machine Learning.

It's considered a best practice to avoid any sensitive data in your code, like authentication information. Therefore, whenever possible, you should work with datastores and data assets in Azure Machine Learning. However, during experimentation in notebooks, you may want to connect directly to a storage location to avoid unnecessary overhead.

### Create a datastore

In Azure Machine Learning, **datastores** are abstractions for cloud data sources. They encapsulate the information needed to connect to data sources, and securely store this connection information so that you don’t have to code it in your scripts.

The benefits of using datastores are:

- Provides easy-to-use URIs to your data storage.
- Facilitates data discovery within Azure Machine Learning.
- Securely stores connection information, without exposing secrets and keys to data scientists.

When you create a datastore with an existing storage account on Azure, you have the choice between two different authentication methods:

![Diagram of two different authentication methods Azure Machine Learning datastores use to connect to external data sources.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/make-data-available-azure-machine-learning/media/datastores.png)

- **Credential-based**: Use a _service principal_, _shared access signature_ (_SAS_) token or _account key_ to authenticate access to your storage account.
- **Identity-based**: Use your _Microsoft Entra identity_ or _managed identity_.

#### Understand types of datastores

Azure Machine Learning supports the creation of datastores for multiple kinds of Azure data source, including:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure File Share
- Azure Data Lake (Gen 2)

#### Use the built-in datastores

Every workspace has four built-in datastores (two connecting to Azure Storage blob containers, and two connecting to Azure Storage file shares), which are used as system storages by Azure Machine Learning.

In most machine learning projects, you need to work with data sources of your own. For example, you can integrate your machine learning solution with data from existing applications or data engineering pipelines.

#### Create a datastore

Datastores are attached to workspaces and are used to store connection information to storage services. When you create a datastore, you provide a name that can be used to retrieve the connection information.

Datastores allow you to easily connect to storage services without having to provide all necessary details every time you want to read or write data. It also creates a protective layer if you want users to use the data, but not connect to the underlying storage service directly.

##### Create a datastore for an Azure Blob Storage container

You can create a datastore through the graphical user interface, the Azure command-line interface (CLI), or the Python software development kit (SDK).

Depending on the storage service you want to connect to, there are different options for Azure Machine Learning to authenticate.

For example, when you want to create a datastore to connect to an Azure Blob Storage container, you can use an account key:

```python
blob_datastore = AzureBlobDatastore(
    			name = "blob_example",
    			description = "Datastore pointing to a blob container",
    			account_name = "mytestblobstore",
    			container_name = "data-container",
    			credentials = AccountKeyConfiguration(
        			account_key="XXXxxxXXXxXXXXxxXXX"
    			),
)
ml_client.create_or_update(blob_datastore)
```

Alternatively, you can create a datastore to connect to an Azure Blob Storage container by using a SAS token to authenticate:

```python
blob_datastore = AzureBlobDatastore(
name="blob_sas_example",
description="Datastore pointing to a blob container",
account_name="mytestblobstore",
container_name="data-container",
credentials=SasTokenConfiguration(
sas_token="?xx=XXXX-XX-XX&xx=xxxx&xxx=xxx&xx=xxxxxxxxxxx&xx=XXXX-XX-XXXXX:XX:XXX&xx=XXXX-XX-XXXXX:XX:XXX&xxx=xxxxx&xxx=XXxXXXxxxxxXXXXXXXxXxxxXXXXXxxXXXXXxXXXXxXXXxXXxXX"
),
)
ml_client.create_or_update(blob_datastore)
```

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to create datastores to connect to other types of cloud storage solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-datastore).

### Create a data asset

As a data scientist, you want to focus on training machine learning models. Though you need access to data as input for a machine learning model, you don't want to worry about _how_ to get access. To simplify getting access to the data you want to work with, you can use **data assets**.

#### Understand data assets

In Azure Machine Learning, data assets are references to where the data is stored, how to get access, and any other relevant metadata. You can create data assets to get access to data in datastores, Azure storage services, public URLs, or data stored on your local device.

The benefits of using data assets are:

- You can **share and reuse data** with other members of the team such that they don't need to remember file locations.
- You can **seamlessly access data** during model training (on any supported compute type) without worrying about connection strings or data paths.
- You can **version** the metadata of the data asset.

There are three main types of data assets you can use:

![Diagram of different types of data assets in Azure Machine Learning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/make-data-available-azure-machine-learning/media/datasets.png)

- **URI file**: Points to a specific file.
- **URI folder**: Points to a folder.
- **MLTable**: Points to a folder or file, and includes a schema to read as tabular data.

>**Note**: **URI** stands for **Uniform Resource Identifier** and stands for a storage location on your local computer, Azure Blob or Data Lake Storage, publicly available https location, or even an attached datastore.

#### When to use data assets

Data assets are most useful when executing machine learning tasks as Azure Machine Learning jobs. As a job, you can run a Python script that takes inputs and generates outputs. A data asset can be parsed as both an input or output of an Azure Machine Learning job.

Let’s take a look at each of the types of data assets, how to create them, and how to use the data asset in a job.

#### Create a URI file data asset

A URI file data asset points to a specific file. Azure Machine Learning only stores the path to the file, which means you can point to any type of file. When you use the data asset, you specify how you want to read the data, which depends on the type of data you're connecting to.

The supported paths you can use when creating a URI file data asset are:

- Local: `./<path>`
- Azure Blob Storage: `wasbs://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<folder>/<file>`
- Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2): `abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<folder>/<file>`
- Datastore: `azureml://datastores/<datastore_name>/paths/<folder>/<file>`

>**Important**: When you create a data asset and point to a file or folder stored on your local device, a copy of the file or folder will be uploaded to the default datastore `workspaceblobstore`. You can find the file or folder in the `LocalUpload` folder. By uploading a copy, you'll still be able to access the data from the Azure Machine Learning workspace, even when the local device on which the data is stored is unavailable.

To create a URI file data asset, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

my_path = '<supported-path>'

my_data = Data(
    path=my_path,
    type=AssetTypes.URI_FILE,
    description="<description>",
    name="<name>",
    version="<version>"
)

ml_client.data.create_or_update(my_data)
```

When you parse the URI file data asset as input in an Azure Machine Learning job, you first need to read the data before you can work with it.

Imagine you create a Python script you want to run as a job, and you set the value of the input parameter `input_data` to be the URI file data asset (which points to a CSV file). You can read the data by including the following code in your Python script:

```python
import argparse
import pandas as pd

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--input_data", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

df = pd.read_csv(args.input_data)
print(df.head(10))
```

If your URI file data asset points to a different type of file, you need to use the appropriate Python code to read the data. For example, if instead of CSV files, you're working with JSON files, you'd use `pd.read_json()` instead.

#### Create a URI folder data asset

A URI folder data asset points to a specific folder. It works similar to a URI file data asset and supports the same paths.

To create a URI folder data asset with the Python SDK, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

my_path = '<supported-path>'

my_data = Data(
    path=my_path,
    type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER,
    description="<description>",
    name="<name>",
    version='<version>'
)

ml_client.data.create_or_update(my_data)
```

When you parse the URI folder data asset as input in an Azure Machine Learning job, you first need to read the data before you can work with it.

Imagine you create a Python script you want to run as a job, and you set the value of the input parameter `input_data` to be the URI folder data asset (which points to multiple CSV files). You can read all CSV files in the folder and concatenate them, which you can do by including the following code in your Python script:

```python
import argparse
import glob
import pandas as pd

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--input_data", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

data_path = args.input_data
all_files = glob.glob(data_path + "/*.csv")
df = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f) for f in all_files), sort=False)
```

Depending on the type of data you're working with, the code you use to read the files can change.

#### Create a MLTable data asset

A MLTable data asset allows you to point to tabular data. When you create a MLTable data asset, you specify the schema definition to read the data. As the schema is already defined and stored with the data asset, you don't have to specify how to read the data when you use it.

Therefore, you want to use a MLTable data asset when the schema of your data is complex or changes frequently. Instead of changing how to read the data in every script that uses the data, you only have to change it in the data asset itself.

When you define the schema when creating a MLTable data asset, you can also choose to only specify a subset of the data.

For certain features in Azure Machine Learning, like Automated Machine Learning, you need to use a MLTable data asset, as Azure Machine Learning needs to know how to read the data.

To define the schema, you can include a **MLTable file** in the same folder as the data you want to read. The MLTable file includes the path pointing to the data you want to read, and how to read the data:

```yml
type: mltable

paths:
  - pattern: ./*.txt
transformations:
  - read_delimited:
      delimiter: ','
      encoding: ascii
      header: all_files_same_headers
```

>**Tip**: Learn more on [how to create the MLTable file and which transformations you can include](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-mltable).

To create a MLTable data asset with the Python SDK, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

my_path = '<path-including-mltable-file>'

my_data = Data(
    path=my_path,
    type=AssetTypes.MLTABLE,
    description="<description>",
    name="<name>",
    version='<version>'
)

ml_client.data.create_or_update(my_data)
```

When you parse a MLTable data asset as input to a Python script you want to run as an Azure Machine Learning job, you can include the following code to read the data:

```python
import argparse
import mltable
import pandas

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--input_data", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

tbl = mltable.load(args.input_data)
df = tbl.to_pandas_dataframe()

print(df.head(10))
```

A common approach is to convert the tabular data to a Pandas data frame. However, you can also convert the data to a Spark data frame if that suits your workload better.
### Make data available in Azure Machine Learning

Although it’s fairly common to work with data on their local file system, in an enterprise environment it can be more effective to store the data in a central location where multiple data scientists and machine learning engineers can access it.

In this exercise, you’ll explore _datastores_ and _data assets_, which are the primary objects used to abstract data access in Azure Machine Learning.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use a Shell script which uses the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary resources. Next, you’ll use the Designer in the Azure Machine Learning studio to train and compare models.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute resources, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. Enter the following commands in the terminal to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. Enter the following commands after the repo has been cloned, to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/03
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Explore the default datastores

When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, a Storage Account is automatically created and connected to your workspace. You’ll explore how the Storage Account is connected.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the new resource group named **rg-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Storage Account in the resource group. The name often starts with the name you provided for the workspace (without hyphens).
3. Review the **Overview** page of the Storage Account. Note that the Storage Account has several options for **Data storage** as shown in the Overview pane, and in the left menu.
4. Select **Containers** to explore the Blob storage part of the Storage Account.
5. Note the **azureml-blobstore-…** container. The default datastore for data assets uses this container to store data.
6. Using the + **Container** button at the top of the screen, create a new container and name it `training-data`.
7. Select **File shares** from the left menu to explore the File share part of the Storage Account.
8. Note the **code-…** file share. Any notebooks in the workspace are stored here. After cloning the lab materials, you can find the files in this file share, in the **code-…/Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder.

#### Copy the access key

To create a datastore in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you need to provide some credentials. An easy way to provide the workspace with access to a Blob storage is to use the account key.

1. In the Storage Account, select the **Access keys** tab from the left menu.
2. Note that two keys are provided: key1 and key2. Each key has the same functionality.
3. Select **Show** for the **Key** field under **key1**.
4. Copy the value of the **Key** field to a notepad. You’ll need to paste this value into the notebook later.
5. Copy the name of your storage account from the top of the page. The name should start with **mlwdp100storage…** You’ll need to paste this value into the notebook later too.

> **Note**: Copy the account key and name to a notepad to avoid automatic capitalization (which happens in Word). The key is case-sensitive.

#### Clone the lab materials

To create a datastore and data assets with the Python SDK, you’ll need to clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-labs**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
     pip install mltable
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages were not installed.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

**Optionally**, in another browser tab, navigate back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true). Explore the file share **code-…** in the Storage account again to find the cloned lab materials in the newly created **azure-ml-labs** folder.

#### Create a datastore and data assets

The code to create a datastore and data assets with the Python SDK is provided in a notebook.

1. Open the **Labs/03/Work with data.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

#### Optional: Explore the data assets

**Optionally**, you can explore how the data assets are stored in the associated Storage Account.

1. Navigate to the **Data** tab in the Azure Machine Learning studio to explore the data assets.
2. Select the **diabetes-local** data asset name to explore its details.
    
    Under **Data sources** for the **diabetes-local** data asset, you’ll find where the file has been uploaded to. The path starting with **LocalUpload/…** shows the path within the Storage Account container **azureml-blobstore-…**. You can verify the file exists by navigating to that path in the Azure portal.
    

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Work with compute targets in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

As a data scientist, you can train machine learning models on your local device. For large-scale projects, a single local device can limit you to efficiently train machine learning models. When you use cloud compute for machine learning workloads, you're ready to scale your work when needed.

In Azure Machine Learning, you can use various types of managed cloud computes. By using any of the compute options in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can save time on managing compute.

Whether you're working in notebooks during experimentation, or need to run scripts for production, Azure Machine Learning compute helps you run your workloads at scale.
### Choose the appropriate compute target

In Azure Machine Learning, _compute targets_ are physical or virtual computers on which jobs are run.

#### Understand the available types of compute

Azure Machine Learning supports multiple types of compute for experimentation, training, and deployment. By having multiple types of compute, you can select the most appropriate type of compute target for your needs.

![Diagram of different hyperparameter values resulting in different models by performing hyperparameter tuning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/work-compute-resources-azure-machine-learning/media/compute-targets.png)

- **Compute instance**: Behaves similarly to a virtual machine and is primarily used to run notebooks. It's ideal for _experimentation_.
- **Compute clusters**: Multi-node clusters of virtual machines that automatically scale up or down to meet demand. A cost-effective way to run scripts that need to process large volumes of data. Clusters also allow you to use parallel processing to distribute the workload and reduce the time it takes to run a script.
- **Kubernetes clusters**: Cluster based on Kubernetes technology, giving you more control over how the compute is configured and managed. You can attach your self-managed Azure Kubernetes (AKS) cluster for cloud compute, or an Arc Kubernetes cluster for on-premises workloads.
- **Attached compute**: Allows you to attach existing compute like Azure virtual machines or Azure Databricks clusters to your workspace.
- **Serverless compute**: A fully managed, on-demand compute you can use for training jobs.

>**Note**: Azure Machine Learning offers you the option to create and manage your own compute or to use compute that is fully managed by Azure Machine Learning.

#### When to use which type of compute?

In general, there are some best practices that you can follow when working with compute targets. To understand how to choose the appropriate type of compute, several examples are provided. Remember that which type of compute you use always depends on your specific situation.

##### Choose a compute target for experimentation

Imagine you're a data scientist and you're asked to develop a new machine learning model. You likely have a small subset of the training data with which you can experiment.

During experimentation and development, you prefer working in a Jupyter notebook. A notebook experience benefits most from a compute that is continuously running.

Many data scientists are familiar with running notebooks on their local device. A cloud alternative managed by Azure Machine Learning is a _compute instance_. Alternatively, you can also opt for _Spark serverless compute_ to run Spark code in notebooks, if you want to make use of Spark's distributed compute power.

##### Choose a compute target for production

After experimentation, you can train your models by running Python scripts to prepare for production. Scripts will be easier to automate and schedule for when you want to retrain your model continuously over time. You can run scripts as (pipeline) jobs.

When moving to production, you want the compute target to be ready to handle large volumes of data. The more data you use, the better the machine learning model is likely to be.

When training models with scripts, you want an on-demand compute target. A _compute cluster_ automatically scales up when the script(s) need to be executed, and scales down when the script finishes executing. If you want an alternative that you don't have to create and manage, you can use Azure Machine Learning's _serverless compute_.

##### Choose a compute target for deployment

The type of compute you need when using your model to generate predictions depends on whether you want batch or real-time predictions.

For batch predictions, you can run a pipeline job in Azure Machine Learning. Compute targets like compute clusters and Azure Machine Learning's serverless compute are ideal for pipeline jobs as they're on-demand and scalable.

When you want real-time predictions, you need a type of compute that is running continuously. Real-time deployments therefore benefit from more lightweight (and thus more cost-efficient) compute. Containers are ideal for real-time deployments. When you deploy your model to a managed online endpoint, Azure Machine Learning creates and manages containers for you to run your model. Alternatively, you can attach Kubernetes clusters to manage the necessary compute to generate real-time predictions.
### Create and use a compute instance

When you want to execute code in notebooks, you can choose to use a **compute instance** managed by Azure Machine Learning. You can create a compute instance in the Azure Machine Learning studio, using the Azure command-line interface (CLI), or the Python software development kit (SDK).

#### Create a compute instance with the Python SDK

To create a compute instance with the Python SDK, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ComputeInstance

ci_basic_name = "basic-ci-12345"
ci_basic = ComputeInstance(
    name=ci_basic_name, 
    size="STANDARD_DS3_v2"
)
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(ci_basic).result()
```

To understand which parameters the `ComputeInstance` class expects, you can review the [reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.computeinstance).

>**Note**: Compute instances need to have a unique name across an Azure region (for example within west europe). If the name already exists, an error message will tell you to try again with another name.

Alternatively, you can also create a compute instance by using a script. With a script, you ensure that any necessary packages, tools, or software is automatically installed on the compute and you can clone any repositories to the compute instance. When you need to create compute instances for multiple users, using a script allows you to create a consistent development environment for everyone.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to customize the compute instance with a script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-customize-compute-instance).

##### Assign a compute instance to a user

As a data scientist, you can attach a compute instance to notebooks to run cells within the notebook. To be allowed to work with the compute instance, it needs to be assigned to you as a user.

A compute instance can only be assigned to _one_ user, as the compute instance can't handle parallel workloads. When you create a new compute instance, you can assign it to someone else if you have the appropriate permissions.

##### Minimize compute time

When you're actively working on code in a notebook, you want your compute instance to be running. When you're not executing any code, you want your compute instance to be stopped to save on costs.

When a compute instance is assigned to you, you can start and stop a compute instance whenever you need. You can also add a schedule to the compute instance to start or stop at set times. Additionally, you can configure a compute to automatically shut down when it has been idle for a set amount of time.

By scheduling your compute instance to stop at the end of every day, you avoid unnecessary costs if you forget to stop a compute instance.

#### Use a compute instance

To use a compute instance, you need an application that can host notebooks. The easiest option to work with the compute instance is through the integrated notebooks experience in the Azure Machine Learning studio.

You can prefer to work with Visual Studio Code for easier source control of your code. If you want to edit and run code in Visual Studio Code, you can attach a compute instance to run notebook cells remotely.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to create and manage an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-manage-compute-instance).

### Create and use a compute cluster

After experimentation and development, you want your code to be production-ready. When you run code in production environments, it's better to use scripts instead of notebooks. When you run a script, you want to use a compute target that is scalable.

Within Azure Machine Learning, **compute clusters** are ideal for running scripts. You can create a compute cluster in the Azure Machine Learning studio, using the Azure command-line interface (CLI), or the Python software development kit (SDK).

#### Create a compute cluster with the Python SDK

To create a compute cluster with the Python SDK, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

cluster_basic = AmlCompute(
    name="cpu-cluster",
    type="amlcompute",
    size="STANDARD_DS3_v2",
    location="westus",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=2,
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120,
    tier="low_priority",
)
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(cluster_basic).result()
```

To understand which parameters the `AmlCompute` class expects, you can review the [reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.amlcompute).

When you create a compute cluster, there are three main parameters you need to consider:

- `size`: Specifies the _virtual machine type_ of each node within the compute cluster. Based on the [sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). Next to size, you can also specify whether you want to use CPUs or GPUs.
- `max_instances`: Specifies the _maximum number of nodes_ your compute cluster can scale out to. The number of parallel workloads your compute cluster can handle is analogous to the number of nodes your cluster can scale to.
- `tier`: Specifies whether your virtual machines are _low priority_ or _dedicated_. Setting to low priority can lower costs as you're not guaranteed availability.

#### Use a compute cluster

There are three main scenarios in which you can use a compute cluster:

- Running a pipeline job you built in the Designer.
- Running an Automated Machine Learning job.
- Running a script as a job.

In each of these scenarios, a compute cluster is ideal as a compute cluster automatically scales up when a job is submitted, and automatically shut down when a job is completed.

A compute cluster also allows you to train multiple models in parallel, which is a common practice when using Automated Machine Learning.

You can run a Designer pipeline job and an Automated Machine Learning job through the Azure Machine Learning studio. When you submit the job through the studio, you can set the compute target to the compute cluster you created.

When you prefer a code-first approach, you can set the compute target to your compute cluster by using the Python SDK.

For example, when you run a script as a command job, you can set the compute target to your compute cluster with the following code:
```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python diabetes-training.py",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="cpu-cluster",
    display_name="train-with-cluster",
    experiment_name="diabetes-training"
    )

# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
aml_url = returned_job.studio_url
print("Monitor your job at", aml_url)
```

After submitting a job that uses a compute cluster, the compute cluster scales out to one or more nodes. Resizing takes a few minutes, and your job starts running once the necessary nodes are provisioned. When a job's status is _preparing_, the compute cluster is being prepared. When the status is _running_, the compute cluster is ready, and the job is running.

### Work with compute resources in Azure Machine Learning

One of the key benefits of the cloud is the ability to use scalable, on-demand compute resources for cost-effective processing of large data.

In this exercise, you’ll learn how to use cloud compute in Azure Machine Learning to run experiments and production code at scale.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

## Work with environments in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

As a data scientist, you want to write code that works in any development environment. Whether you're using local or cloud compute, the code should successfully execute to train a machine learning model for example.

To run code, you need to ensure necessary packages, libraries, and dependencies are installed on the compute you use to run the code. In Azure Machine Learning, **environments** list and store the necessary packages that you can reuse across compute targets.
### Understand environments

In an enterprise machine learning solution, where experiments may be run in various compute contexts, it can be important to be aware of the environments in which your experiment code is running. You can use Azure Machine Learning **environments** to create environments and specify runtime configuration for an experiment.

When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, **curated** environments are automatically created and made available to you. Alternatively, you can create and manage your own **custom** environments and register them in the workspace. Creating and registering custom environments makes it possible to define consistent, reusable runtime contexts for your experiments - regardless of where the experiment script is run.

#### What is an environment in Azure Machine Learning?

Python code runs in the context of a _virtual environment_ that defines the version of the Python runtime to be used as well as the installed packages available to the code. In most Python installations, packages are installed and managed in environments using `conda` or `pip`.

To improve portability, you usually create environments in Docker containers that are in turn hosted on compute targets, such as your development computer, virtual machines, or clusters in the cloud.

![Diagram of environments, in containers, in compute targets.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/work-environments-azure-machine-learning/media/environment.png)

Azure Machine Learning builds environment definitions into Docker images and conda environments. When you use an environment, Azure Machine Learning builds the environment on the **Azure Container registry** associated with the workspace.

>**Tip**: When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can choose whether to use an existing Azure Container registry, or whether to let the workspace create a new registry for you when needed.

To view all available environments within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can list the environments in the studio, using the Azure CLI, or the Python SDK.

For example, to list the environments using the Python SDK:

```python
envs = ml_client.environments.list()
for env in envs:
    print(env.name)
```

To review the details of a specific environment, you can retrieve an environment by its registered name:

```python
env = ml_client.environments.get(name="my-environment", version="1")
print(env)
```

### Explore and use curated environments

**Curated environments** are prebuilt environments for the most common machine learning workloads, available in your workspace by default.

Curated environments use the prefix **AzureML-** and are designed to provide for scripts that use popular machine learning frameworks and tooling.

For example, there are curated environments for when you want to run a script that trains a regression, clustering, or classification model with Scikit-Learn.

To explore a curated environment, you can view it in the studio, using the Azure CLI, or the Python SDK.

The following command allows you to retrieve the description and tags of a curated environment with the Python SDK:
```python
env = ml_client.environments.get("AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu", version=44)
print(env. description, env.tags)
```

#### Use a curated environment

Most commonly, you use environments when you want to run a script as a (**command**) **job**.

To specify which environment you want to use to run your script, you reference an environment by its name and version.

For example, the following code shows how to configure a command job with the Python SDK, which uses a curated environment including Scikit-Learn:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="train-with-curated-environment",
    experiment_name="train-with-curated-environment"
)

# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
```

#### Test and troubleshoot a curated environment

As curated environments allow for faster deployment time, it's a best practice to first explore whether one of the pre-created curated environments can be used to run your code.

You can verify that a curated environment includes all necessary packages by reviewing its details. Then, you can test by using the environment to run the script.

If an environment doesn't include all necessary packages to run your code, your job fails.

When a job fails, you can review the detailed error logs in the **Outputs + logs** tab of your job in the Azure Machine Learning studio.

A common error message that indicates your environment is incomplete, is `ModuleNotFoundError`. The module that isn't found is listed in the error message. By reviewing the error message, you can update the environment to include the libraries to ensure the necessary packages are installed on the compute target before running the code.

When you need to specify other necessary packages, you can use a curated environment as reference for your own custom environments by modifying the Dockerfiles that back these curated environments.

### Create and use custom environments

When you need to create your own environment in Azure Machine Learning to list all necessary packages, libraries, and dependencies to run your scripts, you can create **custom environments**.

You can define an environment from a Docker image, a Docker build context, and a conda specification with Docker image.

#### Create a custom environment from a Docker image

The easiest approach is likely to be to create an environment from a Docker image. Docker images can be hosted in a public registry like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or privately stored in an Azure Container registry.

Many open-source frameworks are encapsulated in public images to be found on Docker Hub. For example, you can find a public Docker image that contains all necessary packages to train a deep learning model with [PyTorch](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch).

To create an environment from a Docker image, you can use the Python SDK:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env_docker_image = Environment(
    image="pytorch/pytorch:latest",
    name="public-docker-image-example",
    description="Environment created from a public Docker image.",
)
ml_client.environments.create_or_update(env_docker_image)
```

You can also use the Azure Machine Learning base images to create an environment (which are similar to the images used by curated environments):

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env_docker_image = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    name="aml-docker-image-example",
    description="Environment created from a Azure ML Docker image.",
)
ml_client.environments.create_or_update(env_docker_image)
```

#### Create a custom environment with a conda specification file

Though Docker images contain all necessary packages when working with a specific framework, it may be that you need to include other packages to run your code.

For example, you may want to train a model with PyTorch, and track the model with MLflow.

When you need to include other packages or libraries in your environment, you can add a conda specification file to a Docker image when creating the environment.

A conda specification file is a YAML file, which lists the packages that need to be installed using `conda` or `pip`. Such a YAML file may look like:

```yml
name: basic-env-cpu
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
```

 Tip

Review the conda documentation on how to [create an environment manually](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually?azure-portal=true) for information on the standard format for conda files.

To create an environment from a base Docker image and a conda specification file, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env_docker_conda = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    conda_file="./conda-env.yml",
    name="docker-image-plus-conda-example",
    description="Environment created from a Docker image plus Conda environment.",
)
ml_client.environments.create_or_update(env_docker_conda)
```

>**Note**: Since all curated environments are prefixed with **AzureML-**, you can't create an environment with the same prefix.

#### Use an environment

Most commonly, you use environments when you want to run a script as a (**command**) **job**.

To specify which environment you want to use to run your script, you reference an environment using the `<curated-environment-name>:<version>` or `<curated-environment-name>@latest` syntax.

For example, the following code shows how to configure a command job with the Python SDK, which uses a curated environment including Scikit-Learn:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py",
    environment="docker-image-plus-conda-example:1",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="train-custom-env",
    experiment_name="train-custom-env"
)

# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
```

When you submit the job, the environment is built. The first time you use an environment, it can take 10-15 minutes to build the environment. You can review the logs of the environment build in the logs of the job.

When Azure Machine Learning builds a new environment, it's added to the list of custom environments in the workspace. The image of the environment is hosted in the Azure Container registry associated to the workspace. Whenever you use the same environment for another job (and another script), the environment is ready to go and doesn't need to be build again.
### Work with environments in Azure Machine Learning

To run notebooks and scripts, you must ensure that the required packages are installed. Environments allow you to specify the runtimes and Python packages that must be used by your compute to run your code.

In this exercise, you will learn about environments and how to use them when training machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning compute.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to train a classification model with Automated Machine Learning.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute resources, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).

# Experiment with Azure Machine Learning
## Find the best classification model with Automated Machine Learning
### Introduction

Going through trial and error to find the best performing model can be time-consuming. Instead of manually having to test and evaluate various configurations to train a machine learning model, you can automate it with **automated machine learning** or **AutoML**.

AutoML allows you to try multiple preprocessing transformations and algorithms with your data to find the best machine learning model.

![Diagram illustrating how multiple models are trained and evaluated, after the model with the best performing metrics is selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/find-best-classification-model-automated-machine-learning/media/automated-machine-learning.jpg)

Imagine you want to find the best performing **classification** model. You can create an AutoML experiment using the visual interface of Azure Machine Learning studio, the Azure command-line interface (CLI), or the Python software development kit (SDK).

>**Note**: You can use AutoML for other tasks such as regression, forecasting, image classification, and natural language processing. Learn more about [when you can use AutoML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml).

As a data scientist, you may prefer to configure your AutoML experiment with the Python SDK.
### Preprocess data and configure featurization

Before you can run an automated machine learning (AutoML) experiment, you need to prepare your data. When you want to train a classification model, you'll only need to provide the training data.

After you've collected the data, you need to create a **data asset** in Azure Machine Learning. In order for AutoML to understand how to read the data, you need to create a **MLTable** data asset that includes the schema of the data.

You can create a MLTable data asset when your data is stored in a folder together with a MLTable file. When you have created the data asset, you can specify it as input with the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes
from azure.ai.ml import Input

my_training_data_input = Input(type=AssetTypes.MLTABLE, path="azureml:input-data-automl:1")
```

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to create a MLTable data asset in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-mltable).

Once you've created the data asset, you can configure the AutoML experiment. Before AutoML trains a classification model, preprocessing transformations can be applied to your data.

#### Understand scaling and normalization

AutoML applies scaling and normalization to numeric data automatically, helping prevent any large-scale features from dominating training. During an AutoML experiment, multiple scaling or normalization techniques will be applied.

#### Configure optional featurization

You can choose to have AutoML apply preprocessing transformations, such as:

- Missing value imputation to eliminate nulls in the training dataset.
- Categorical encoding to convert categorical features to numeric indicators.
- Dropping high-cardinality features, such as record IDs.
- Feature engineering (for example, deriving individual date parts from DateTime features)

By default, AutoML will perform featurization on your data. You can disable it if you don't want the data to be transformed.

If you do want to make use of the integrated featurization function, you can customize it. For example, you can specify which imputation method should be used for a specific feature.

After an AutoML experiment is completed, you'll be able to review which scaling and normalization methods have been applied. You'll also get notified if AutoML has detected any issues with the data, like whether there are missing values or class imbalance.
### Run an Automated Machine Learning experiment

To run an automated machine learning (AutoML) experiment, you can configure and submit the job with the Python SDK.

The algorithms AutoML uses will depend on the task you specify. When you want to train a classification model, AutoML will choose from a list of classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- And others...

>**Tip**: For a full list of supported algorithms, explore [the overview of supported algorithms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-auto-train#supported-algorithms?azure-portal=true).

#### Restrict algorithm selection

By default, AutoML will randomly select from the full range of algorithms for the specified task. You can choose to block individual algorithms from being selected; which can be useful if you know that your data isn't suited to a particular type of algorithm. You also may want to block certain algorithms if you have to comply with a policy that restricts the type of machine learning algorithms you can use in your organization.

#### Configure an AutoML experiment

When you use the Python SDK (v2) to configure an AutoML experiment or job, you configure the experiment using the `automl` class. For classification, you'll use the `automl.classification` function as shown in the following example:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import automl

# configure the classification job
classification_job = automl.classification(
    compute="aml-cluster",
    experiment_name="auto-ml-class-dev",
    training_data=my_training_data_input,
    target_column_name="Diabetic",
    primary_metric="accuracy",
    n_cross_validations=5,
    enable_model_explainability=True
)
```

>**Note**: AutoML needs a MLTable data asset as input. In the example, `my_training_data_input` refers to a MLTable data asset created in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

##### Specify the primary metric

One of the most important settings you must specify is the **primary_metric**. The primary metric is the target performance metric for which the optimal model will be determined. Azure Machine Learning supports a set of named metrics for each type of task.

To retrieve the list of metrics available when you want to train a classification model, you can use the **ClassificationPrimaryMetrics** function as shown here:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.automl import ClassificationPrimaryMetrics
 
list(ClassificationPrimaryMetrics)
```

>**Tip**: You can find a full list of primary metrics and their definitions in [evaluate automated machine learning experiment results](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml).

##### Set the limits

Training machine learning models will cost compute. To minimize costs and time spent on training, you can set limits to an AutoML experiment or job by using `set_limits()`.

There are several options to set limits to an AutoML experiment:

- `timeout_minutes`: Number of minutes after which the complete AutoML experiment is terminated.
- `trial_timeout_minutes`: Maximum number of minutes one trial can take.
- `max_trials`: Maximum number of trials, or models that will be trained.
- `enable_early_termination`: Whether to end the experiment if the score isn't improving in the short term.

```python
classification_job.set_limits(
    timeout_minutes=60, 
    trial_timeout_minutes=20, 
    max_trials=5,
    enable_early_termination=True,
)
```

To save time, you can also run multiple trials in parallel. When you use a compute cluster, you can have as many parallel trials as you have nodes. The maximum number of parallel trials is therefore related to the maximum number of nodes your compute cluster has. If you want to set the maximum number of parallel trials to be less than the maximum number of nodes, you can use `max_concurrent_trials`.

##### Set the training properties

AutoML will try various combinations of featurization and algorithms to train a machine learning model. If you already know that certain algorithms aren't well-suited for your data, you can exclude (or include) a subset of the available algorithms.

You can also choose whether you want to allow AutoML to use ensemble models.

#### Submit an AutoML experiment

You can submit an AutoML job with the following code:

```python
# submit the AutoML job
returned_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    classification_job
) 
```

You can monitor AutoML job runs in the Azure Machine Learning studio. To get a direct link to the AutoML job by running the following code:

```python
aml_url = returned_job.studio_url
print("Monitor your job at", aml_url)
```
### Evaluate and compare models

When an automated machine learning (AutoML) experiment has completed, you'll want to review the models that have been trained and decide which one performed best.

In the Azure Machine Learning studio, you can select an AutoML experiment to explore its details.

On the **Overview** page of the AutoML experiment run, you can review the input data asset and the summary of the best model. To explore all models that have been trained, you can select the **Models** tab:

![Screenshot of the models tab in an automated machine learning experiment run in the Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/find-best-classification-model-automated-machine-learning/media/models-overview.png)

#### Explore preprocessing steps

When you've enabled featurization for your AutoML experiment, data guardrails will automatically be applied too. The three data guardrails that are supported for classification models are:

- Class balancing detection.
- Missing feature values imputation.
- High cardinality feature detection.

Each of these data guardrails will show one of three possible states:

- **Passed**: No problems were detected and no action is required.
- **Done**: Changes were applied to your data. You should review the changes AutoML has made to your data.
- **Alerted**: An issue was detected but couldn't be fixed. You should review the data to fix the issue.

Next to data guardrails, AutoML can apply scaling and normalization techniques to each model that is trained. You can review the technique applied in the list of models under **Algorithm name**.

For example, the algorithm name of a model listed may be `MaxAbsScaler, LightGBM`. `MaxAbsScaler` refers to a scaling technique where each feature is scaled by its maximum absolute value. `LightGBM` refers to the classification algorithm used to train the model.

#### Retrieve the best run and its model

When you're reviewing the models in AutoML, you can easily identify the best run based on the primary metric you specified. In the Azure Machine Learning studio, the models are automatically sorted to show the best performing model at the top.

In the **Models** tab of the AutoML experiment, you can **edit the columns** if you want to show other metrics in the same overview. By creating a more comprehensive overview that includes various metrics, it may be easier to compare models.

To explore a model even further, you can generate explanations for each model that has been trained. When configuring an AutoML experiment, you can specify that explanations should be generated for the best performing model. If however, you're interested in the interpretability of another model, you can select the model in the overview and select **Explain model**.

>**Note**: Explaining a model is an approximation to the model's interpretability. Specifically, explanations will estimate the relative importance of features on the target feature (what the model is trained to predict). Learn more about [model interpretability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-interpretability).

>**Tip**: Learn more about [how to evaluate AutoML runs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml).

### Find the best classification model with Automated Machine Learning

## Track model training in Jupyter notebooks with MLflow
### Introduction

Imagine you're a data scientist for a company developing an application for a cancer research lab. The application is to be used by researchers who upload an image of tissue to determine whether or not it's healthy tissue. You're asked to train the model to detect breast cancer on a large image database that contains examples of healthy and unhealthy tissue

You're familiar with Jupyter notebooks, which you plan to use to develop the model. However, you want to periodically retrain the model to create a better performing model that must then be deployed so that researchers can use the model in the application they're using.

### Configure MLflow for model tracking in notebooks

As a data scientist, you'll want to develop a model in a notebook as it allows you to quickly test and run code.

Anytime you train a model, you want the results to be reproducible. By tracking and logging your work, you can review your work at any time and decide what the best approach is to train a model.

**MLflow** is an open-source library for tracking and managing your machine learning experiments. In particular, **MLflow Tracking** is a component of MLflow that logs everything about the model you're training, such as **parameters**, **metrics**, and **artifacts**.

To use MLflow in notebooks in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you'll need to install the necessary libraries and set Azure Machine Learning as the tracking store. When you've configured MLflow, you can start to use MLflow when training models in notebooks.

#### Configure MLflow in notebooks

You can create and edit notebooks within Azure Machine Learning or on a local device.

##### Use Azure Machine Learning notebooks

Within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can create notebooks and connect the notebooks to an Azure Machine Learning managed **compute instance**.

When you're running a notebook on a compute instance, MLflow is already configured, and ready to be used.

To verify that the necessary packages are installed, you can run the following code:

```python
pip show mlflow
pip show azureml-mlflow
```

The `mlflow` package is the open-source library. The `azureml-mlflow` package contains the integration code of Azure Machine Learning with MLflow.

##### Use MLflow on a local device

When you prefer working in notebooks on a local device, you can also make use of MLflow. You'll need to configure MLflow by completing the following steps:

1. Install the `mlflow` and `azureml-mlflow` package.
    
    ```bash
    pip install mlflow
    pip install azureml-mlflow
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the Azure Machine Learning studio.
    
3. Select the name of the workspace you're working on in the top right corner of the studio.
    
4. Select **View all properties in Azure portal**. A new tab will open to take you to the Azure Machine Learning service in the Azure portal.
    
5. Copy the value of the **MLflow tracking URI**.
    

[![Screenshot of overview page in Azure portal showing the MLflow tracking URI.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/track-model-training-jupyter-notebooks-mlflow/media/workspace-overview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/track-model-training-jupyter-notebooks-mlflow/media/workspace-overview.png#lightbox)

6. Use the following code in your local notebook to configure MLflow to point to the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and set it to the workspace tracking URI.
    
    ```python
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri = "MLFLOW-TRACKING-URI"
    ```
    

>**Tip**: Learn about alternative approaches to [set up the tracking environment when working on a local device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs). For example, you can also use the Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 for Python, together with the workspace configuration file, to set the tracking URI.

When you've configured MLflow to track your model's results and store it in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, you're ready to experiment in a notebook.

### Train and track models in notebooks

As a data scientist, you use notebooks to experiment and train models. To group model training results, you'll use **experiments**. To track model metrics with MLflow when training a model in a notebook, you can use MLflow's logging capabilities.

#### Create an MLflow experiment

You can create a MLflow experiment, which allows you to group runs. If you don't create an experiment, MLflow will assume the default experiment with name `Default`.

To create an experiment, run the following command in a notebook:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name="heart-condition-classifier")
```

#### Log results with MLflow

Now, you're ready to train your model. To start a run tracked by MLflow, you'll use `start_run()`. Next, to track the model, you can:

- Enable **autologging**.
- Use **custom logging**.

##### Enable autologging

MLflow supports automatic logging for popular machine learning libraries. If you're using a library that is supported by autolog, then MLflow tells the framework you're using to log all the metrics, parameters, artifacts, and models that the framework considers relevant.

You can turn on autologging by using the `autolog` method for the framework you're using. For example, to enable autologging for XGBoost models you can use `mlflow.xgboost.autolog()`.

>**Tip**: Find a list of [all supported frameworks for autologging in the official MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging?azure-portal=true).

A notebook cell that trains and tracks a classification model using autologging may be similar to the following code example:

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.xgboost.autolog()

    model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric="logloss")
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], verbose=False)

```

As soon as `mlflow.xgboost.autolog()` is called, MLflow will start a run within an experiment in Azure Machine Learning to start tracking the experiment's run.

When the job has completed, you can review all logged metrics in the studio.

[![Screenshot of overview page of MLflow experiment with autologging in Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/track-model-training-jupyter-notebooks-mlflow/media/autolog-results.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/track-model-training-jupyter-notebooks-mlflow/media/autolog-results.png#lightbox)

##### Use custom logging

Additionally, you can manually log your model with MLflow. Manually logging models is helpful when you want to log supplementary or custom information that isn't logged through autologging.

>**Note**: You can choose to only use custom logging, or use custom logging in combination with autologging.

Common functions used with custom logging are:

- `mlflow.log_param()`: Logs a single key-value parameter. Use this function for an input parameter you want to log.
- `mlflow.log_metric()`: Logs a single key-value metric. Value must be a number. Use this function for any output you want to store with the run.
- `mlflow.log_artifact()`: Logs a file. Use this function for any plot you want to log, save as image file first.
- `mlflow.log_model()`: Logs a model. Use this function to create an MLflow model, which may include a custom signature, environment, and input examples.

>**Tip**: Learn more about how to track models with MLflow by exploring the [official MLflow documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html), or the [Azure Machine Learning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-log-view-metrics)

To use custom logging in a notebook, start a run and log any metric you want:

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric="logloss")
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], verbose=False)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
```

Custom logging gives you more flexibility, but also creates more work as you'll have to define any parameter, metric, or artifact you want to log.

When the job has completed, you can review all logged metrics in the studio.

### Track model training in notebooks with MLflow

Often, you’ll start a new data science project by experimenting and training multiple models. To track your work and keep an overview of the models you train and how they perform, you can use MLflow tracking.

In this exercise, you’ll use MLflow within a notebook running on a compute instance to log model training.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to train a classification model with Automated Machine Learning.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and a compute instance, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/07
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK and the MLflow library on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
     pip install mlflow
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing a notebook, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Track model training with MLflow

Now that you have all the necessary resources, you can run the notebook to configure and use MLflow when training models in a notebook.

1. Open the **Labs/07/Track model training with MLflow.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.
4. Review the new job that’s created every time you train a model.
    
    > **Note:** When you train a model, the cell’s output will show a link to the job run. If the link returns an error, you can still review the job run by selecting **Jobs** on the left side panel.
    

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.


# Optimize model training with Azure Machine Learning

## Run a training script as a command job in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

A common challenge when developing machine learning models is to prepare for production scenarios. When you write code to process data and train models, you want the code to be scalable, repeatable, and ready for automation.

Though notebooks are ideal for experimentation and development, scripts are a better fit for production workloads. In Azure Machine Learning, you can run a script as a **command job**. When you submit a command job, you can configure various parameters like the input data and the compute environment. Azure Machine Learning also helps you track your work when working with command jobs to make it easier to compare workloads.
### Convert a notebook to a script
When you've used notebooks for experimentation and development, you'll first need to convert a notebook to a script. Alternatively, you might choose to skip using notebooks and work only with scripts. Either way, there are some recommendations when creating scripts to have production-ready code.

Scripts are ideal for testing and automation in your production environment. To create a production-ready script, you'll need to:

- Remove nonessential code.
- Refactor your code into functions.
- Test your script in the terminal.

#### Remove all nonessential code

The main benefit of using notebooks is being able to quickly explore your data. For example, you can use `print()` and `df.describe()` statements to explore your data and variables. When you create a script that will be used for automation, you want to avoid including code written for exploratory purposes.

The first thing you therefore need to do to convert your code to production code is to remove the nonessential code. Especially when you'll run the code regularly, you want to avoid executing anything nonessential to reduce cost and compute time.

#### Refactor your code into functions

When using code in business processes, you want the code to be easy to read so that anyone can maintain it. One common approach to make code easier to read and test is to use functions.

For example, you might have used the following example code in a notebook to read and split the data:

```python
# read and visualize the data
print("Reading data...")
df = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
df.head()

# split data
print("Splitting data...")
X, y = df[['Pregnancies','PlasmaGlucose','DiastolicBloodPressure','TricepsThickness','SerumInsulin','BMI','DiabetesPedigree','Age']].values, df['Diabetic'].values

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)
```

As functions also allow you to test parts of your code, you might prefer to create _multiple smaller functions_, rather than one large function. If you want to test a part of your code, you can choose to only test a small part and avoid running more code than necessary.

You can refactor the code shown in the example into two functions:

- Read the data
- Split the data

An example of refactored code might be the following:

```python
def main(csv_file):
    # read data
    df = get_data(csv_file)

    # split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(df)

# function that reads the data
def get_data(path):
    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    
    return df

# function that splits the data
def split_data(df):
    X, y = df[['Pregnancies','PlasmaGlucose','DiastolicBloodPressure','TricepsThickness',
    'SerumInsulin','BMI','DiabetesPedigree','Age']].values, df['Diabetic'].values

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
```

>**Note**: You may have noticed that nonessential code was also omitted in the refactored code. You may choose to use `print` statements in production code if you'll review the script's output and you want to ensure all code ran as expected. However, when you know you're not going to review the output of a script in a terminal, it's best to remove any code that has no purpose.

#### Test your script

Before using scripts in production environments, for example by integrating them with automation pipelines, you'll want to test whether the scripts work as expected.

One simple way to test your script, is to run the script in a terminal. Within the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can quickly run a script in the terminal of the compute instance.

When you open a script in the **Notebooks** page of the Azure Machine Learning studio, you can choose to **save and run the script in the terminal**.

Alternatively, you can navigate directly to the terminal of the compute instance. Navigate to the **Compute** page and select the **Terminal** of the compute instance you want to use. You can use the following command to run a Python script named `train.py`:

```bash
python train.py
```

Outputs of `print` statements will show in the terminal. Any possible errors will also appear in the terminal.
### Run a script as a command job

When you have a script that train a machine learning model, you can run it as a command job in Azure Machine Learning.

#### Configure and submit a command job

To run a script as a command job, you'll need to configure and submit the job.

To configure a command job with the Python SDK (v2), you'll use the `command` function. To run a script, you'll need to specify values for the following parameters:

- `code`: The folder that includes the script to run.
- `command`: Specifies which file to run.
- `environment`: The necessary packages to be installed on the compute before running the command.
- `compute`: The compute to use to run the command.
- `display_name`: The name of the individual job.
- `experiment_name`: The name of the experiment the job belongs to.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [the `command` function and all possible parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml) in the reference documentation for the Python SDK (v2).

You can configure a command job to run a file named `train.py`, on the compute cluster named `aml-cluster` with the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="train-model",
    experiment_name="train-classification-model"
    )
```

When your job is configured, you can submit it, which will initiate the job and run the script:

```python
# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
```

You can monitor and review the job in the Azure Machine Learning studio. All jobs with the same experiment name will be grouped under the same experiment. You can find an individual job using the specified display name.

All inputs and outputs of a command job are tracked. You can review which command you specified, which compute was used, and which environment was used to run the script on the specified compute.
### Use parameters in a command job

You can increase the flexibility of your scripts by using parameters. For example, you might have created a script that trains a machine learning model. You can use the same script to train a model on different datasets, or using various hyperparameter values.

#### Working with script arguments

To use parameters in a script, you must use a library such as `argparse` to read arguments passed to the script and assign them to variables.

For example, the following script reads an arguments named `training_data`, which specifies the path to the training data.

```python
# import libraries
import argparse
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def main(args):
    # read data
    df = get_data(args.training_data)

# function that reads the data
def get_data(path):
    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    
    return df

def parse_args():
    # setup arg parser
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

    # add arguments
    parser.add_argument("--training_data", dest='training_data',
                        type=str)

    # parse args
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # return args
    return args

# run script
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # parse args
    args = parse_args()

    # run main function
    main(args)
```

Any parameters you expect should be defined in the script. In the script, you can specify what type of value you expect for each parameter and whether you want to set a default value.

#### Passing arguments to a script

To pass parameter values to a script, you need to provide the argument value in the command.

For example, if you would pass a parameter value when running a script in a terminal, you would use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --training_data diabetes.csv
```

In the example, `diabetes.csv` is a local file. Alternatively, you could specify the path to a data asset created in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Similarly, when you want to pass a parameter value to a script you want to run as a command job, you'll specify the values in the command:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py --training_data diabetes.csv",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="train-model",
    experiment_name="train-classification-model"
    )
```

After submitting a command job, you can review the input and output parameters you specified.

### Run a training script as a command job in Azure Machine Learning

A notebook is ideal for experimentation and development. Once you’ve developed a machine learning model and it’s ready for production, you’ll want to train it with a script. You can run a script as a command job.

In this exercise, you’ll test a script and then run it as a command job.

7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:

    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Convert a notebook to a script

Using a notebook attached to a compute instance is ideal for experimentation and development as it allows you to immediately run code you’ve written and review its output. To move from development to production, you’ll want to use scripts. As a first step, you can use the Azure Machine Learning studio to convert your notebook to a script.

1. Open the **Labs/08/src/Train classification model.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells to explore the code and train a model.
4. Select the ☰ icon at the top of the notebook to view the **notebook menu**.
5. Expand **Export as**, and select **Python (.py)** to convert the notebook to a Python script.
6. Name the new file `train-classification-model`.
7. Once the new file is created, the script should automatically be opened. Explore the file and note that it contains the same code as the notebook.
8. Select the ▷▷ icon at the top of the notebook to **save and run the script in the terminal**.
9. The script is initiated by the command **python train-classification-model.py** and the output should be shown below the command.
    
    > **Note:** If the script returns an ImportError for libstdc++6, run the following commands in the terminal before running the script again:
    > 
    > ```bash
    > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    > sudo apt-get update
    > sudo apt-get upgrade libstdc++6
    > ```
    

#### Test a script with the terminal

After converting a notebook to a script, you may want to further refine it. One best practice when working with scripts, is to use functions. When your script consists of functions, it’s easier to unit test your code. When you use functions, your script will consist of blocks of code, each block performing a specific task.

1. Open the **Labs/08/src/train-model-parameters.py** script and explore its contents. Note that there is a main function which includes four other functions:
    
    - Read data
    - Split data
    - Train model
    - Evaluate model
    
    After the main function, each function is defined. Note how each function defines the expected input and output.
    
2. Select the ▷▷ icon at the top of the notebook to **save and run the script in the terminal**. You should get an error after **Reading data…** telling you that it couldn’t get the data because the file path was invalid.
    
    Scripts allow you to parameterize your code to easily change the input data or parameters. In this case, the script expects an input parameter for the data path which we didn’t provide. You can find the defined and expected parameters at the end of the script in the **parse_args()** function.
    
    There are two input parameters defined:
    
    - **–training_data** which expects a string.
    - **–reg_rate** which expects a number, but has a default value of 0.01.
    
    To run the script successfully, you’ll need to specify the value for the training data parameters. Let’s do that by referring to the **diabetes.csv** file which is stored in the same folder as the training script.
    
3. In the terminal, run the following commands:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/08/src/
     python train-model-parameters.py --training_data diabetes.csv
    ```
    

The script should successfully run and as a result, the output should show the accuracy and AUC of the trained model.

Testing the script in the terminal is ideal for verifying whether the script works as expected. If there is any issue with the code, you’ll receive an error in the terminal.

**Optionally**, edit the code to force an error and run the command again in the terminal to run the script. For example, remove the line **import pandas as pd**, save and run the script with the input parameter to review the error message.

#### Run a script as a command job

If you know your script works, you can run it as a command job. By running your script as a command job, you’ll be able to track all the inputs and outputs of the script.

1. Open the **Labs/08/Run script as command job.ipynb** notebook.
2. Run all cells in the notebook.
3. In the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Jobs** page.
4. Navigate to the **diabetes-train-script** job to explore the overview of the command job you ran.
5. Navigate to the **Code** tab. All contents of the **src** folder, which was the value of the **code** parameter of the command job, are copied here. You can review the training script which was executed by the command job.
6. Navigate to the **Outputs + logs** tab.
7. Open the **std_log.txt** file and explore its contents. The content of this file is the output of the command. Remember the same output was shown in the terminal when you tested the script there. If the job is unsuccessful because of an issue with the script, the error message will be shown here.

**Optionally**, edit the code to force an error and use the notebook to initiate the command job again. For example, remove the line **import pandas as pd** from the script and save the script. Or, edit the command job configuration to explore the error messages when something is wrong with the job configuration itself instead of the script.

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Track model training with MLflow in jobs
### Introduction

Scripts are ideal when you want to run machine learning workloads in production environments. Imagine you're a data scientist who has developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes. The model is performing as expected and you created a training script. The script is used to retrain the model every month when new data has been collected.

You'll want to monitor the model's performance over time. You want to understand whether the new data every month benefits the model. Next to tracking models that are trained in notebooks, you can also use **MLflow** to track models in scripts.

**MLflow** is an open-source platform that helps you to track model metrics and artifacts across platforms and is integrated with Azure Machine Learning.

When you use MLflow together with Azure Machine Learning, you can run training scripts locally or in the cloud. You can review model metrics and artifacts in the Azure Machine Learning workspace to compare runs and decide on next steps.

### Track metrics with MLflow

When you train a model with a script, you can include MLflow in the scripts to track any parameters, metrics, and artifacts. When you run the script as a job in Azure Machine Learning, you're able to review all input parameters and outputs for each run.

#### Understand MLflow

MLflow is an open-source platform, designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. As it's open source, it can be used when training models on different platforms. Here, we explore how we can integrate MLflow with Azure Machine Learning jobs.

There are two options to track machine learning jobs with MLflow:

- Enable autologging using `mlflow.autolog()`
- Use logging functions to track custom metrics using `mlflow.log_*`

Before you can use either of these options, you need to set up the environment to use MLflow.

#### Include MLflow in the environment

To use MLflow during training job, the `mlflow` and `azureml-mlflow` pip packages need to be installed on the compute executing the script. Therefore, you need to include these two packages in the environment. You can create an environment by referring to a YAML file that describes the Conda environment. As part of the Conda environment, you can include these two packages.

For example, in this custom environment `mlflow` and `azureml-mlflow` are installed using pip:

```yml
name: mlflow-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pip
  - pip:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib
    - mlflow
    - azureml-mlflow
```

Once the environment is defined and registered, make sure to refer to it when submitting a job.

#### Enable autologging

When working with one of the common libraries for machine learning, you can enable autologging in MLflow. Autologging logs parameters, metrics, and model artifacts without anyone needing to specify what needs to be logged.

Autologging is supported for the following libraries:

- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow and Keras
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Spark
- Fastai
- Pytorch

To enable autologging, add the following code to your training script:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.autolog()
```

#### Log metrics with MLflow

In your training script, you can decide whatever custom metric you want to log with MLflow.

Depending on the type of value you want to log, use the MLflow command to store the metric with the experiment run:

- `mlflow.log_param()`: Log single key-value parameter. Use this function for an input parameter you want to log.
- `mlflow.log_metric()`: Log single key-value metric. Value must be a number. Use this function for any output you want to store with the run.
- `mlflow.log_artifact()`: Log a file. Use this function for any plot you want to log, save as image file first.

To add MLflow to an existing training script, you can add the following code:

```python
import mlflow

reg_rate = 0.1
mlflow.log_param("Regularization rate", reg_rate)
```

>**Tip**: For a complete overview of how to use MLflow Tracking, read the [MLflow documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).

#### Submit the job

Finally, you need to submit the training script as a job in Azure Machine Learning. When you use MLflow in a training script and run it as a job, all tracked parameters, metrics, and artifacts are stored with the job run.

You configure the job as usual. You only need to make sure that the environment you refer to in the job includes the necessary packages, and the script describes which metrics you want to log.
### View metrics and evaluate models

After you've trained and tracked models with MLflow in Azure Machine Learning, you can explore the metrics and evaluate your models.

- Review metrics in the Azure Machine Learning studio.
- Retrieve runs and metrics with MLflow.

>**Note**: Azure Machine Learning uses the concept of jobs when you run a script. Multiple job runs in Azure Machine Learning can be grouped within one experiment. MLflow uses a similar syntax where each script is a run, which is part of an experiment.

#### View the metrics in the Azure Machine Learning studio

When your job is completed, you can review the logged parameters, metrics, and artifacts in the Azure Machine Learning studio.

When you review job runs in the Azure Machine Learning studio, you'll explore a job run's metrics, which is part of an experiment.

To view the metrics through an intuitive user interface, you can:

1. Open the Studio by navigating to [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com/).
2. Find your experiment run and open it to view its details.
3. In the **Details** tab, all logged parameters are shown under **Params**.
4. Select the **Metrics** tab and select the metric you want to explore.
5. Any plots that are logged as artifacts can be found under **Images**.
6. The model assets that can be used to register and deploy the model are stored in the **models** folder under **Outputs + logs**.

>**Tip**: Read the documentation to learn more on [how to track models with MLflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow).

#### Retrieve metrics with MLflow in a notebook

When you run a training script as a job in Azure Machine Learning, and track your model training with MLflow, you can query the runs in a notebook by using MLflow. Using MLflow in a notebook gives you more control over which runs you want to retrieve to compare.

When using MLflow to query your runs, you'll refer to experiments and runs.

##### Search all the experiments

You can get all the active experiments in the workspace using MLFlow:

```python
experiments = mlflow.search_experiments(max_results=2)
for exp in experiments:
    print(exp.name)
```

If you want to retrieve archived experiments too, then include the option `ViewType.ALL`:

```python
from mlflow.entities import ViewType

experiments = mlflow.search_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)
for exp in experiments:
    print(exp.name)
```

To retrieve a specific experiment, you can run:

```python
exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
print(exp)
```

>**Tip**: Explore the documentation on how to [search experiments with MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-experiments.html)

##### Retrieve runs

MLflow allows you to search for runs inside of any experiment. You need either the experiment ID or the experiment name.

For example, when you want to retrieve the metrics of a specific run:

```python
mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id)
```

You can search runs across multiple experiments if necessary. Searching across experiments may be useful in case you want to compare runs of the same model when it's being logged in different experiments (by different people or different project iterations).

You can use `search_all_experiments=True` if you want to search across all the experiments in the workspace.

By default, experiments are ordered descending by `start_time`, which is the time the experiment was queued in Azure Machine Learning. However, you can change this default by using the parameter `order_by`.

For example, if you want to sort by start time and only show the last two results:

```python
mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)
```

You can also look for a run with a specific combination in the hyperparameters:

```python
mlflow.search_runs(
    exp.experiment_id, filter_string="params.num_boost_round='100'", max_results=2
)
```

>**Tip**: Explore the documentation on how to [search runs with MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-runs.html)

### Use MLflow to track training jobs

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. MLflow Tracking is a component that logs and tracks your training job metrics, parameters and model artifacts.

In this exercise, you’ll use MLflow to track model training run as a command job.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to run a command job.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute instance, and a compute cluster, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/08
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Submit MLflow jobs from a notebook

Now that you have all the necessary resources, you can run the notebook to submit the job, which uses MLflow to track model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

1. Open the **Labs/08/Use MLflow to track jobs.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.


## Perform hyperparameter tuning with Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

In machine learning, models are trained to predict unknown labels for new data based on correlations between known labels and features found in the training data. Depending on the algorithm used, you may need to specify **hyperparameters** to configure how the model is trained.

For example, the _logistic regression_ algorithm uses a _regularization rate_ hyperparameter to counteract overfitting; and deep learning techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use hyperparameters like _learning rate_ to control how weights are adjusted during training, and _batch size_ to determine how many data items are included in each training batch.

>**Note**: Machine Learning is an academic field with its own particular terminology. Data scientists refer to the values determined from the training features as _parameters_, so a different term is required for values that are used to configure training behavior but which are _**not**_ derived from the training data - hence the term _hyperparameter_.

The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly affect the resulting model, making it important to select the best possible values for your particular data and predictive performance goals.

#### Tuning hyperparameters

![Diagram of different hyperparameter values resulting in different models by performing hyperparameter tuning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/perform-hyperparameter-tuning-azure-machine-learning-pipelines/media/08-01-hyperdrive.png)

**Hyperparameter tuning** is accomplished by training the multiple models, using the same algorithm and training data but different hyperparameter values. The resulting model from each training run is then evaluated to determine the performance metric for which you want to optimize (for example, _accuracy_), and the best-performing model is selected.

In Azure Machine Learning, you can tune hyperparameters by submitting a script as a **sweep job**. A sweep job will run a **trial** for each hyperparameter combination to be tested. Each trial uses a training script with parameterized hyperparameter values to train a model, and logs the target performance metric achieved by the trained model.
### Define a search space

The set of hyperparameter values tried during hyperparameter tuning is known as the **search space**. The definition of the range of possible values that can be chosen depends on the type of hyperparameter.

#### Discrete hyperparameters

Some hyperparameters require _discrete_ values - in other words, you must select the value from a particular _finite_ set of possibilities. You can define a search space for a discrete parameter using a **Choice** from a list of explicit values, which you can define as a Python **list** (`Choice(values=[10,20,30])`), a **range** (`Choice(values=range(1,10))`), or an arbitrary set of comma-separated values (`Choice(values=(30,50,100))`)

You can also select discrete values from any of the following discrete distributions:

- `QUniform(min_value, max_value, q)`: Returns a value like round(Uniform(min_value, max_value) / q) * q
- `QLogUniform(min_value, max_value, q)`: Returns a value like round(exp(Uniform(min_value, max_value)) / q) * q
- `QNormal(mu, sigma, q)`: Returns a value like round(Normal(mu, sigma) / q) * q
- `QLogNormal(mu, sigma, q)`: Returns a value like round(exp(Normal(mu, sigma)) / q) * q

#### Continuous hyperparameters

Some hyperparameters are _continuous_ - in other words you can use any value along a scale, resulting in an _infinite_ number of possibilities. To define a search space for these kinds of value, you can use any of the following distribution types:

- `Uniform(min_value, max_value)`: Returns a value uniformly distributed between min_value and max_value
- `LogUniform(min_value, max_value)`: Returns a value drawn according to exp(Uniform(min_value, max_value)) so that the logarithm of the return value is uniformly distributed
- `Normal(mu, sigma)`: Returns a real value that's normally distributed with mean mu and standard deviation sigma
- `LogNormal(mu, sigma)`: Returns a value drawn according to exp(Normal(mu, sigma)) so that the logarithm of the return value is normally distributed

#### Defining a search space

To define a search space for hyperparameter tuning, create a dictionary with the appropriate parameter expression for each named hyperparameter.

For example, the following search space indicates that the `batch_size` hyperparameter can have the value 16, 32, or 64, and the `learning_rate` hyperparameter can have any value from a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice, Normal

command_job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),    
    learning_rate=Normal(mu=10, sigma=3),
)
```
### Configure a sampling method

The specific values used in a hyperparameter tuning run, or **sweep job**, depend on the type of **sampling** used.

There are three main sampling methods available in Azure Machine Learning:

- **Grid sampling**: Tries every possible combination.
- **Random sampling**: Randomly chooses values from the search space.
    - **Sobol**: Adds a seed to random sampling to make the results reproducible.
- **Bayesian sampling**: Chooses new values based on previous results.

>**Note**: Sobol is a variation of random sampling.

#### Grid sampling

Grid sampling can only be applied when all hyperparameters are discrete, and is used to try every possible combination of parameters in the search space.

For example, in the following code example, grid sampling is used to try every possible combination of discrete _batch_size_ and _learning_rate_ value:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice

command_job_for_sweep = command_job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),
    learning_rate=Choice(values=[0.01, 0.1, 1.0]),
)

sweep_job = command_job_for_sweep.sweep(
    sampling_algorithm = "grid",
    ...
)
```

#### Random sampling

Random sampling is used to randomly select a value for each hyperparameter, which can be a mix of discrete and continuous values as shown in the following code example:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Normal, Uniform

command_job_for_sweep = command_job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),   
    learning_rate=Normal(mu=10, sigma=3),
)

sweep_job = command_job_for_sweep.sweep(
    sampling_algorithm = "random",
    ...
)
```

##### Sobol

You may want to be able to reproduce a random sampling sweep job. If you expect that you do, you can use Sobol instead. Sobol is a type of random sampling that allows you to use a seed. When you add a seed, the sweep job can be reproduced, and the search space distribution is spread more evenly.

The following code example shows how to use Sobol by adding a seed and a rule, and using the `RandomSamplingAlgorithm` class:
```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import RandomSamplingAlgorithm

sweep_job = command_job_for_sweep.sweep(
    sampling_algorithm = RandomSamplingAlgorithm(seed=123, rule="sobol"),
    ...
)
```

#### Bayesian sampling

Bayesian sampling chooses hyperparameter values based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm, which tries to select parameter combinations that will result in improved performance from the previous selection. The following code example shows how to configure Bayesian sampling:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Uniform, Choice

command_job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),    
    learning_rate=Uniform(min_value=0.05, max_value=0.1),
)

sweep_job = command_job_for_sweep.sweep(
    sampling_algorithm = "bayesian",
    ...
)
```

You can only use Bayesian sampling with **choice**, **uniform**, and **quniform** parameter expressions.
### Configure early termination

Hyperparameter tuning helps you fine-tune your model and select the hyperparameter values that will make your model perform best.

For you to find the best model, however, can be a never-ending conquest. You always have to consider whether it's worth the time and expense of testing new hyperparameter values to find a model that may perform better.

Each trial in a sweep job, a new model is trained with a new combination of hyperparameter values. If training a new model doesn't result in a significantly better model, you may want to stop the sweep job and use the model that performed best so far.

When you configure a sweep job in Azure Machine Learning, you can also set a maximum number of trials. A more sophisticated approach may be to stop a sweep job when newer models don't produce significantly better results. To stop a sweep job based on the performance of the models, you can use an **early termination policy**.

#### When to use an early termination policy

Whether you want to use an early termination policy may depend on the search space and sampling method you're working with.

For example, you may choose to use a _grid sampling_ method over a _discrete_ search space that results in a maximum of six trials. With six trials, a maximum of six models will be trained and an early termination policy may be unnecessary.

An early termination policy can be especially beneficial when working with continuous hyperparameters in your search space. Continuous hyperparameters present an unlimited number of possible values to choose from. You'll most likely want to use an early termination policy when working with continuous hyperparameters and a random or Bayesian sampling method.

#### Configure an early termination policy

There are two main parameters when you choose to use an early termination policy:

- `evaluation_interval`: Specifies at which interval you want the policy to be evaluated. Every time the primary metric is logged for a trial counts as an interval.
- `delay_evaluation`: Specifies when to start evaluating the policy. This parameter allows for at least a minimum of trials to complete without an early termination policy affecting them.

New models may continue to perform only slightly better than previous models. To determine the extent to which a model should perform better than previous trials, there are three options for early termination:

- **Bandit policy**: Uses a `slack_factor` (relative) or `slack_amount`(absolute). Any new model must perform within the slack range of the best performing model.
- **Median stopping policy**: Uses the median of the averages of the primary metric. Any new model must perform better than the median.
- **Truncation selection policy**: Uses a `truncation_percentage`, which is the percentage of lowest performing trials. Any new model must perform better than the lowest performing trials.

#### Bandit policy

You can use a bandit policy to stop a trial if the target performance metric underperforms the best trial so far by a specified margin.

For example, the following code applies a bandit policy with a delay of five trials, evaluates the policy at every interval, and allows an absolute slack amount of 0.2.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import BanditPolicy

sweep_job.early_termination = BanditPolicy(
    slack_amount = 0.2, 
    delay_evaluation = 5, 
    evaluation_interval = 1
)
```

Imagine the primary metric is the accuracy of the model. When after the first five trials, the best performing model has an accuracy of 0.9, any new model needs to perform better than (0.9-0.2) or 0.7. If the new model's accuracy is higher than 0.7, the sweep job will continue. If the new model has an accuracy score lower than 0.7, the policy will terminate the sweep job.

![Diagram of two examples when using a bandit policy: one model performs sufficiently good, the other underperforms.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/perform-hyperparameter-tuning-azure-machine-learning-pipelines/media/bandit-policy.png)

You can also apply a bandit policy using a slack _factor_, which compares the performance metric as a ratio rather than an absolute value.

#### Median stopping policy

A median stopping policy abandons trials where the target performance metric is worse than the median of the running averages for all trials.

For example, the following code applies a median stopping policy with a delay of five trials and evaluates the policy at every interval.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import MedianStoppingPolicy

sweep_job.early_termination = MedianStoppingPolicy(
    delay_evaluation = 5, 
    evaluation_interval = 1
)
```

Imagine the primary metric is the accuracy of the model. When the accuracy is logged for the sixth trial, the metric needs to be higher than the median of the accuracy scores so far. Suppose the median of the accuracy scores so far is 0.82. If the new model's accuracy is higher than 0.82, the sweep job will continue. If the new model has an accuracy score lower than 0.82, the policy will stop the sweep job, and no new models will be trained.

![Diagram of two examples when using a median stopping policy: one model performs sufficiently good, the other underperforms.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/perform-hyperparameter-tuning-azure-machine-learning-pipelines/media/median-stopping.png)

#### Truncation selection policy

A truncation selection policy cancels the lowest performing _X_% of trials at each evaluation interval based on the _truncation_percentage_ value you specify for _X_.

For example, the following code applies a truncation selection policy with a delay of four trials, evaluates the policy at every interval, and uses a truncation percentage of 20%.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import TruncationSelectionPolicy

sweep_job.early_termination = TruncationSelectionPolicy(
    evaluation_interval=1, 
    truncation_percentage=20, 
    delay_evaluation=4 
)
```

Imagine the primary metric is the accuracy of the model. When the accuracy is logged for the fifth trial, the metric should **not** be in the worst 20% of the trials so far. In this case, 20% translates to one trial. In other words, if the fifth trial is **not** the worst performing model so far, the sweep job will continue. If the fifth trial has the lowest accuracy score of all trials so far, the sweep job will stop.

![Diagram of two examples when using a truncation selection policy: one model performs sufficiently good, the other underperforms.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/perform-hyperparameter-tuning-azure-machine-learning-pipelines/media/truncation-selection.png)
### Use a sweep job for hyperparameter tuning

In Azure Machine Learning, you can tune hyperparameters by running a **sweep job**.

#### Create a training script for hyperparameter tuning

To run a sweep job, you need to create a training script just the way you would do for any other training job, except that your script _**must**_:

- Include an argument for each hyperparameter you want to vary.
- Log the target performance metric with **MLflow**. A logged metric enables the sweep job to evaluate the performance of the trials it initiates, and identify the one that produces the best performing model.

>**Note**: Learn how to [track machine learning experiments and models with MLflow within Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs).

For example, the following example script trains a logistic regression model using a `--regularization` argument to set the _regularization rate_ hyperparameter, and logs the _accuracy_ metric with the name `Accuracy`:

```python
import argparse
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import mlflow

# get regularization hyperparameter
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--regularization', type=float, dest='reg_rate', default=0.01)
args = parser.parse_args()
reg = args.reg_rate

# load the training dataset
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# separate features and labels, and split for training/validatiom
X = data[['feature1','feature2','feature3','feature4']].values
y = data['label'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30)

# train a logistic regression model with the reg hyperparameter
model = LogisticRegression(C=1/reg, solver="liblinear").fit(X_train, y_train)

# calculate and log accuracy
y_hat = model.predict(X_test)
acc = np.average(y_hat == y_test)
mlflow.log_metric("Accuracy", acc)
```

#### Configure and run a sweep job

To prepare the sweep job, you must first create a base **command job** that specifies which script to run and defines the parameters used by the script:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure command job as base
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py --regularization ${{inputs.reg_rate}}",
    inputs={
        "reg_rate": 0.01,
    },
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    )
```

You can then override your input parameters with your search space:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice

command_job_for_sweep = job(
    reg_rate=Choice(values=[0.01, 0.1, 1]),
)
```

Finally, call `sweep()` on your command job to sweep over your search space:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# apply the sweep parameter to obtain the sweep_job
sweep_job = command_job_for_sweep.sweep(
    compute="aml-cluster",
    sampling_algorithm="grid",
    primary_metric="Accuracy",
    goal="Maximize",
)

# set the name of the sweep job experiment
sweep_job.experiment_name="sweep-example"

# define the limits for this sweep
sweep_job.set_limits(max_total_trials=4, max_concurrent_trials=2, timeout=7200)

# submit the sweep
returned_sweep_job = ml_client.create_or_update(sweep_job)
```

#### Monitor and review sweep jobs

You can monitor sweep jobs in Azure Machine Learning studio. The sweep job will initiate trials for each hyperparameter combination to be tried. For each trial, you can review all logged metrics.

Additionally, you can evaluate and compare models by visualizing the trials in the studio. You can adjust each chart to show and compare the hyperparameter values and metrics for each trial.

>**Tip**: Learn more about how to [visualize hyperparameter tuning jobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters#visualize-hyperparameter-tuning-jobs?azure-portal=true).

### Perform hyperparameter tuning with a sweep job

Hyperparameters are variables that affect how a model is trained, but which can’t be derived from the training data. Choosing the optimal hyperparameter values for model training can be difficult, and usually involved a great deal of trial and error.

In this exercise, you’ll use Azure Machine Learning to tune hyperparameters by performing multiple training trials in parallel.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to run a command job.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute instance, and a compute cluster, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/09
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Tune hyperparameters with a sweep job

Now that you have all the necessary resources, you can run the notebook to submit a sweep job.

1. Open the **Labs/09/Hyperparameter tuning.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.


## Run pipelines in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

In Azure Machine Learning, you can experiment in notebooks and train (and retrain) machine learning models by running scripts as jobs.

In an enterprise data science process, you'll want to separate the overall process into individual tasks. You can group tasks together as **pipelines**. Pipelines are key to implementing an effective **Machine Learning Operations** (**MLOps**) solution in Azure.

>**Note**: The term _pipeline_ is used extensively across various domains, including machine learning and software engineering. In Azure Machine Learning, a pipeline contains steps related to the training of a machine learning model. In Azure DevOps or GitHub, a pipeline can refer to a build or release pipelines, which perform the build and configuration tasks required to deliver software. In Azure Synapse Analytics, a pipeline is used to define the data ingestion and transformation process. The focus of this module is on Azure Machine Learning pipelines. However, bear in mind that it's possible to have pipelines across services interact with each other. For example, an Azure DevOps or Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline can trigger an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.

>**Tip**: Learn more about MLOps in relation to Azure Machine Learning with [an introduction to machine learning operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/introduction-machine-learn-operations)

### Create components

**Components** allow you to create reusable scripts that can easily be shared across users within the same Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can also use components to build an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.

#### Use a component

There are two main reasons why you'd use components:

- To build a pipeline.
- To share ready-to-go code.

You'll want to create components when you're _preparing your code for scale_. When you're done with experimenting and developing, and ready to move your model to production.

Within Azure Machine Learning, you can create a component to store code (in your preferred language) within the workspace. Ideally, you design a component to perform a specific action that is relevant to your machine learning workflow.

For example, a component may consist of a Python script that normalizes your data, trains a machine learning model, or evaluates a model.

Components can be easily shared to other Azure Machine Learning users, who can reuse components in their own Azure Machine Learning pipelines.

![Screenshot of available components in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/run-pipelines-azure-machine-learning/media/01-01-components.png)

#### Create a component

A component consists of three parts:

- **Metadata**: Includes the component's name, version, etc.
- **Interface**: Includes the expected input parameters (like a dataset or hyperparameter) and expected output (like metrics and artifacts).
- **Command, code and environment**: Specifies how to run the code.

To create a component, you need two files:

- A script that contains the workflow you want to execute.
- A YAML file to define the metadata, interface, and command, code, and environment of the component.

You can create the YAML file, or use the `command_component()` function as a decorator to create the YAML file.

>**Tip**: Here, we'll focus on creating a YAML file to create a component. Alternatively, learn more about [how to create components using `command_component()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python).

For example, you may have a Python script `prep.py` that prepares the data by removing missing values and normalizing the data:
```python
# import libraries
import argparse
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# setup arg parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

# add arguments
parser.add_argument("--input_data", dest='input_data',
                    type=str)
parser.add_argument("--output_data", dest='output_data',
                    type=str)

# parse args
args = parser.parse_args()

# read the data
df = pd.read_csv(args.input_data)

# remove missing values
df = df.dropna()

# normalize the data    
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
num_cols = ['feature1','feature2','feature3','feature4']
df[num_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df[num_cols])

# save the data as a csv
output_df = df.to_csv(
    (Path(args.output_data) / "prepped-data.csv"), 
    index = False
)
```

To create a component for the `prep.py` script, you'll need a YAML file `prep.yml`:

```yml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/commandComponent.schema.json
name: prep_data
display_name: Prepare training data
version: 1
type: command
inputs:
  input_data: 
    type: uri_file
outputs:
  output_data:
    type: uri_file
code: ./src
environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest
command: >-
  python prep.py 
  --input_data ${{inputs.input_data}}
  --output_data ${{outputs.output_data}}
```

Notice that the YAML file refers to the `prep.py` script, which is stored in the `src` folder. You can load the component with the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import load_component
parent_dir = ""

loaded_component_prep = load_component(source=parent_dir + "./prep.yml")
```

When you've loaded the component, you can use it in a pipeline or register the component.

#### Register a component

To use components in a pipeline, you'll need the script and the YAML file. To make the components accessible to other users in the workspace, you can also register components to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

You can register a component with the following code:

```python
prep = ml_client.components.create_or_update(prepare_data_component)
```

### Create a pipeline

In Azure Machine Learning, a **pipeline** is a workflow of machine learning tasks in which each task is defined as a **component**.

Components can be arranged sequentially or in parallel, enabling you to build sophisticated flow logic to orchestrate machine learning operations. Each component can be run on a specific compute target, making it possible to combine different types of processing as required to achieve an overall goal.

A pipeline can be executed as a process by running the pipeline as a **pipeline job**. Each component is executed as a **child job** as part of the overall pipeline job.

#### Build a pipeline

An Azure Machine Learning pipeline is defined in a YAML file. The YAML file includes the pipeline job name, inputs, outputs, and settings.

You can create the YAML file, or use the `@pipeline()` function to create the YAML file.

>**Tip**: Review the [reference documentation for the `@pipeline()` function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.dsl).

For example, if you want to build a pipeline that first prepares the data, and then trains the model, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.dsl import pipeline

@pipeline()
def pipeline_function_name(pipeline_job_input):
    prep_data = loaded_component_prep(input_data=pipeline_job_input)
    train_model = loaded_component_train(training_data=prep_data.outputs.output_data)

    return {
        "pipeline_job_transformed_data": prep_data.outputs.output_data,
        "pipeline_job_trained_model": train_model.outputs.model_output,
    }
```

To pass a registered data asset as the pipeline job input, you can call the function you created with the data asset as input:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import Input
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

pipeline_job = pipeline_function_name(
    Input(type=AssetTypes.URI_FILE, 
    path="azureml:data:1"
))
```

The `@pipeline()` function builds a pipeline consisting of two sequential steps, represented by the two loaded components.

To understand the pipeline built in the example, let's explore it step by step:

1. The pipeline is built by defining the function `pipeline_function_name`.
2. The pipeline function expects `pipeline_job_input` as the overall pipeline input.
3. The first pipeline step requires a value for the input parameter `input_data`. The value for the input will be the value of `pipeline_job_input`.
4. The first pipeline step is defined by the loaded component for `prep_data`.
5. The value of the `output_data` of the first pipeline step is used for the expected input `training_data` of the second pipeline step.
6. The second pipeline step is defined by the loaded component for `train_model` and results in a trained model referred to by `model_output`.
7. Pipeline outputs are defined by returning variables from the pipeline function. There are two outputs:
    - `pipeline_job_transformed_data` with the value of `prep_data.outputs.output_data`
    - `pipeline_job_trained_model` with the value of `train_model.outputs.model_output`

![Diagram of pipeline structure including all inputs and outputs.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/run-pipelines-azure-machine-learning/media/pipeline-overview.png)

The result of running the `@pipeline()` function is a YAML file that you can review by printing the `pipeline_job` object you created when calling the function:

```python
print(pipeline_job)
```

The output will be formatted as a YAML file, which includes the configuration of the pipeline and its components. Some parameters included in the YAML file are shown in the following example.

```yml
display_name: pipeline_function_name
type: pipeline
inputs:
  pipeline_job_input:
    type: uri_file
    path: azureml:data:1
outputs:
  pipeline_job_transformed_data: null
  pipeline_job_trained_model: null
jobs:
  prep_data:
    type: command
    inputs:
      input_data:
        path: ${{parent.inputs.pipeline_job_input}}
    outputs:
      output_data: ${{parent.outputs.pipeline_job_transformed_data}}
  train_model:
    type: command
    inputs:
      input_data:
        path: ${{parent.outputs.pipeline_job_transformed_data}}
    outputs:
      output_model: ${{parent.outputs.pipeline_job_trained_model}}
tags: {}
properties: {}
settings: {}
```

>**Tip**: Learn more about [the pipeline job YAML schema to explore which parameters are included when building a component-based pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-job-pipeline).

### Run a pipeline job

When you've built a component-based pipeline in Azure Machine Learning, you can run the workflow as a **pipeline job**.

#### Configure a pipeline job

A pipeline is defined in a YAML file, which you can also create using the `@pipeline()` function. After you've used the function, you can edit the pipeline configurations by specifying which parameters you want to change and the new value.

For example, you may want to change the output mode for the pipeline job outputs:

```python
# change the output mode
pipeline_job.outputs.pipeline_job_transformed_data.mode = "upload"
pipeline_job.outputs.pipeline_job_trained_model.mode = "upload"
```

Or, you may want to set the default pipeline compute. When a compute isn't specified for a component, it will use the default compute instead:

```python
# set pipeline level compute
pipeline_job.settings.default_compute = "aml-cluster"
```

You may also want to change the default datastore to where all outputs will be stored:

```python
# set pipeline level datastore
pipeline_job.settings.default_datastore = "workspaceblobstore"
```

To review your pipeline configuration, you can print the pipeline job object:

```python
print(pipeline_job)
```

#### Run a pipeline job

When you've configured the pipeline, you're ready to run the workflow as a pipeline job.

To submit the pipeline job, run the following code:

```python
# submit job to workspace
pipeline_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    pipeline_job, experiment_name="pipeline_job"
)
```

After you submit a pipeline job, a new job will be created in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. A pipeline job also contains child jobs, which represent the execution of the individual components. The Azure Machine Learning studio creates a graphical representation of your pipeline. You can expand the **Job overview** to explore the pipeline parameters, outputs, and child jobs:

![Screenshot of the graphical representation of your pipeline in the Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/run-pipelines-azure-machine-learning/media/pipeline-output.png)

To troubleshoot a failed pipeline, you can check the outputs and logs of the pipeline job and its child jobs.

- If there's an issue with the configuration of the pipeline itself, you'll find more information in the outputs and logs of the pipeline job.
- If there's an issue with the configuration of a component, you'll find more information in the outputs and logs of the child job of the failed component.

#### Schedule a pipeline job

A pipeline is ideal if you want to get your model ready for production. Pipelines are especially useful for automating the retraining of a machine learning model. To automate the retraining of a model, you can schedule a pipeline.

To schedule a pipeline job, you'll use the `JobSchedule` class to associate a schedule to a pipeline job.

There are various ways to create a schedule. A simple approach is to create a time-based schedule using the `RecurrenceTrigger` class with the following parameters:

- `frequency`: Unit of time to describe how often the schedule fires. Value can be either `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, or `month`.
- `interval`: Number of frequency units to describe how often the schedule fires. Value needs to be an integer.

To create a schedule that fires every minute, run the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import RecurrenceTrigger

schedule_name = "run_every_minute"

recurrence_trigger = RecurrenceTrigger(
    frequency="minute",
    interval=1,
)
```

To schedule a pipeline, you'll need `pipeline_job` to represent the pipeline you've built:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import JobSchedule

job_schedule = JobSchedule(
    name=schedule_name, trigger=recurrence_trigger, create_job=pipeline_job
)

job_schedule = ml_client.schedules.begin_create_or_update(
    schedule=job_schedule
).result()
```

The display names of the jobs triggered by the schedule will be prefixed with the name of your schedule. You can review the jobs in the Azure Machine Learning studio:

![Screenshot of the completed jobs scheduled in the Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/run-pipelines-azure-machine-learning/media/scheduled-jobs.png)

To delete a schedule, you first need to disable it:

```python
ml_client.schedules.begin_disable(name=schedule_name).result()
ml_client.schedules.begin_delete(name=schedule_name).result()
```

>**Tip**: Learn more about [the schedules you can create to trigger pipeline jobs in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-schedule-pipeline-job?tabs=python%3Fazure-portal%3Dtrue). Or, explore an [example notebook to learn how to work with schedules](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/schedules/job-schedule.ipynb).

### Run pipelines in Azure Machine Learning

You can use the Python SDK to perform all of the tasks required to create and operate a machine learning solution in Azure. Rather than perform these tasks individually, you can use pipelines to orchestrate the steps required to prepare data, run training scripts, and other tasks.

3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
# Manage and review models in Azure Machine Learning
## Register an MLflow model in Azure Machine Learning
### Introduction

After training, you want to deploy a machine learning model in order to integrate the model with an application. In Azure Machine Learning, you can easily deploy a model to a batch or online endpoint when you register the model with **MLflow**.

Imagine you're a data scientist, working for a company that creates an application for health care practitioners to help diagnose diabetes in patients. The practitioners enter a patient's medical information and expect a response from the application, indicating whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not.

You expect to regularly retrain the model that predicts diabetes. Whenever you have more training data, you want to retrain the model to produce a better performing model. Every time the model is retrained, you want to update the model that is deployed to the endpoint and integrated with the application. By doing so, you're providing the practitioners with the latest version of the model anytime they use the application.
### Log models with MLflow

To train a machine learning model, you can choose to use an open source framework that best suits your needs. After training, you want to deploy your model. **MLflow** is an open source platform that streamlines machine learning deployment, regardless of the type of model you trained and the framework you used.

MLflow is integrated with Azure Machine Learning. The integration with Azure Machine Learning allows you to easily deploy models that you train and track with Mlflow. For example, when you have an MLflow model, you can opt for the no-code deployment in Azure Machine Learning.

>**Note**: Some types of models are currently not supported by Azure Machine Learning and MLflow. In that case, you can register a `custom` model. Learn more about [how to work with (custom) models in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-models).

#### Why use MLflow?

When you train a machine learning model with Azure Machine Learning, you can use MLflow to register your model. MLflow standardizes the packaging of models, which means that an MLflow model can easily be imported or exported across different workflows.

For example, imagine training a model in an Azure Machine Learning workspace used for development. If you want to export the model to another workspace used for production, you can use an MLflow model to easily do so.

When you train and log a model, you store all relevant artifacts in a directory. When you register the model, an `MLmodel` file is created in that directory. The `MLmodel` file contains the model's metadata, which allows for model traceability.

You can register models with MLflow by enabling autologging, or by using custom logging.

>**Note**: MLflow allows you to log a model as an artifact, or as a model. When you log a model as an artifact, the model is treated as a file. When you log a model as a model, you're adding information to the registered model that enables you to use the model directly in pipelines or deployments. Learn more about [the difference between an artifact and a model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow-models#the-mlmodel-format?azure-portal=true)

#### Use autologging to log a model

When you train a model, you can include `mlflow.autolog()` to enable autologging. MLflow's autologging automatically logs parameters, metrics, artifacts, and the model you train. The model is logged when the `.fit()` method is called. The framework you use to train your model is identified and included as the **flavor** of your model.

Optionally, you can specify which flavor you want your model to be identified as by using `mlflow.<flavor>.autolog()`. Some common flavors that you can use with autologging are:

- Keras: `mlflow.keras.autolog()`
- Scikit-learn: `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()`
- LightGBM: `mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()`
- XGBoost: `mlflow.xgboost.autolog()`
- TensorFlow: `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()`
- PyTorch: `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()`
- ONNX: `mlflow.onnx.autolog()`

>**Tip**: Explore the complete list of [MLflow's built-in model flavors](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#built-in-model-flavors?azure-portal=true).

When you use autologging, an output folder is created which includes all necessary model artifacts, including the `MLmodel` file that references these files and includes the model's metadata.

#### Manually log a model

When you want to have more control over how the model is logged, you can use `autolog` (for your parameters, metrics, and other artifacts), and set `log_models=False`. When you set the `log_models` parameter to false, MLflow doesn't automatically log the model, and you can add it manually.

Logging the model allows you to easily deploy the model. To specify how the model should behave at inference time, you can customize the model's expected inputs and outputs. The schemas of the expected inputs and outputs are defined as the signature in the `MLmodel` file.

##### Customize the signature

The model signature defines the schema of the model's inputs and outputs. The signature is stored in JSON format in the `MLmodel` file, together with other metadata of the model.

The model signature can be inferred from datasets or created manually by hand.

To log a model with a signature that is inferred from your training dataset and model predictions, you can use `infer_signature()`. For example, the following example takes the training dataset to infer the schema of the inputs, and the model's predictions to infer the schema of the output:


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_train = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=7, random_state=0)
clf.fit(iris_train, iris.target)

# Infer the signature from the training dataset and model's predictions
signature = infer_signature(iris_train, clf.predict(iris_train))

# Log the scikit-learn model with the custom signature
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, "iris_rf", signature=signature)
```

Alternatively, you can create the signature manually:

```python
from mlflow.models.signature import ModelSignature
from mlflow.types.schema import Schema, ColSpec

# Define the schema for the input data
input_schema = Schema([
  ColSpec("double", "sepal length (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "sepal width (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "petal length (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "petal width (cm)"),
])

# Define the schema for the output data
output_schema = Schema([ColSpec("long")])

# Create the signature object
signature = ModelSignature(inputs=input_schema, outputs=output_schema)
```

>**Note**: Learn more about [logging MLflow models in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-log-mlflow-models) and [MLflow's model signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature-and-input-example?azure-portal=true).

### Understand the MLflow model format

MLflow uses the MLModel format to store all relevant model assets in a folder or directory. One essential file in the directory is the `MLmodel` file. The `MLmodel` file is the single source of truth about how the model should be loaded and used.

#### Explore the MLmodel file format

The `MLmodel` file may include:

- `artifact_path`: During the training job, the model is logged to this path.
- `flavor`: The machine learning library with which the model was created.
- `model_uuid`: The unique identifier of the registered model.
- `run_id`: The unique identifier of job run during which the model was created.
- `signature`: Specifies the schema of the model's inputs and outputs:
    - `inputs`: Valid input to the model. For example, a subset of the training dataset.
    - `outputs`: Valid model output. For example, model predictions for the input dataset.

An example of a MLmodel file created for a computer vision model trained with `fastai` may look like:

```yml
artifact_path: classifier
flavors:
  fastai:
    data: model.fastai
    fastai_version: 2.4.1
  python_function:
    data: model.fastai
    env: conda.yaml
    loader_module: mlflow.fastai
    python_version: 3.8.12
model_uuid: e694c68eba484299976b06ab9058f636
run_id: e13da8ac-b1e6-45d4-a9b2-6a0a5cfac537
signature:
  inputs: '[{"type": "tensor",
             "tensor-spec": 
                 {"dtype": "uint8", "shape": [-1, 300, 300, 3]}
           }]'
  outputs: '[{"type": "tensor", 
              "tensor-spec": 
                 {"dtype": "float32", "shape": [-1,2]}
            }]'

```

The most important things to set are the **flavor** and the **signature**.

##### Choose the flavor

A **flavor** is the machine learning library with which the model was created.

For example, to create an image classification model to detect breast cancer you're using `fastai`. Fastai is a flavor in MLflow that tells you how a model should be persisted and loaded. Because each model flavor indicates how they want to persist and load models, the MLModel format doesn't enforce a single serialization mechanism that all the models need to support. Such a decision allows each flavor to use the methods that provide the best performance or best support according to their best practices - without compromising compatibility with the MLModel standard.

`Python function` flavor is the _default_ model interface for models created from an MLflow run. Any MLflow python model can be loaded as a `python_function` model, which allows for workflows like deployment to work with any python model regardless of which framework was used to produce the model. This interoperability is immensely powerful as it reduces the time to operationalize in multiple environments.

An example of the Python function flavor may look like:

```yml

artifact_path: pipeline
flavors:
  python_function:
    env:
      conda: conda.yaml
      virtualenv: python_env.yaml
    loader_module: mlflow.sklearn
    model_path: model.pkl
    predict_fn: predict
    python_version: 3.8.5
  sklearn:
    code: null
    pickled_model: model.pkl
    serialization_format: cloudpickle
    sklearn_version: 1.2.0
mlflow_version: 2.1.0
model_uuid: b8f9fe56972e48f2b8c958a3afb9c85d
run_id: 596d2e7a-c7ed-4596-a4d2-a30755c0bfa5
signature:
  inputs: '[{"name": "age", "type": "long"}, {"name": "sex", "type": "long"}, {"name":
    "cp", "type": "long"}, {"name": "trestbps", "type": "long"}, {"name": "chol",
    "type": "long"}, {"name": "fbs", "type": "long"}, {"name": "restecg", "type":
    "long"}, {"name": "thalach", "type": "long"}, {"name": "exang", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "oldpeak", "type": "double"}, {"name": "slope", "type": "long"}, {"name":
    "ca", "type": "long"}, {"name": "thal", "type": "string"}]'
  outputs: '[{"name": "target", "type": "long"}]'
```

##### Configure the signature

Apart from flavors, the `MLmodel` file also contains signatures that serve as data contracts between the model and the server running your model.

There are two types of signatures:

- **Column-based**: used for tabular data with a `pandas.Dataframe` as inputs.
- **Tensor-based**: used for n-dimensional arrays or tensors (often used for unstructured data like text or images), with `numpy.ndarray` as inputs.

As the `MLmodel` file is created when you register the model, the signature also is created when you register the model. When you enable MLflow's autologging, the signature is inferred in the best effort way. If you want the signature to be different, you need to manually log the model.

The signature's inputs and outputs are important when deploying your model. When you use Azure Machine Learning's no-code deployment for MLflow models, the inputs and outputs set in the signature will be enforced. In other words, when you send data to a deployed MLflow model, the expected inputs and outputs need to match the schema as defined in the signature.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [model signatures in MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature?azure-portal=true).

### Register an MLflow model

In Azure Machine Learning, models are trained in jobs. When you want to find the model's artifacts, you can find it in the job's outputs. To more easily manage your models, you can also store a model in the Azure Machine Learning **model registry**.

The model registry makes it easy to organize and keep track of your trained models. When you register a model, you store and version your model in the workspace.

Registered models are identified by name and version. Each time you register a model with the same name as an existing one, the registry increments the version. You can also add more metadata tags to more easily search for a specific model.

>**Tip**: You can also register models trained outside Azure Machine Learning by providing the local path to the model's artifacts.

There are three types of models you can register:

- **MLflow**: Model trained and tracked with MLflow. Recommended for standard use cases.
- **Custom**: Model type with a custom standard not currently supported by Azure Machine Learning.
- **Triton**: Model type for deep learning workloads. Commonly used for TensorFlow and PyTorch model deployments.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [Deploy deep learning workloads to production with Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/deploy-deep-learning-workloads-to-production-azure-machine-learning/)

Azure Machine Learning integrates well with MLflow, which is why it's a best practice to log and register an MLflow model. Working with MLflow models makes model management and deployment in Azure Machine Learning easier. During deployment, for example, the environment and scoring script are created for you when using an MLflow model.

#### Register an MLflow model

To register an MLflow model, you can use the studio, the Azure CLI, or the Python SDK.

As a data scientist, you may be most comfortable working with the Python SDK.

To train the model, you can submit a training script as a command job by using the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job

job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train-model-signature.py --training_data diabetes.csv",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="diabetes-train-signature",
    experiment_name="diabetes-training"
    )

# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
aml_url = returned_job.studio_url
print("Monitor your job at", aml_url)
```

Once the job is completed and the model is trained, use the job name to find the job run and register the model from its outputs.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

job_name = returned_job.name

run_model = Model(
    path=f"azureml://jobs/{job_name}/outputs/artifacts/paths/model/",
    name="mlflow-diabetes",
    description="Model created from run.",
    type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL,
)
# Uncomment after adding required details above
ml_client.models.create_or_update(run_model)
```

All registered models are listed in the **Models** page of the Azure Machine Learning studio. The registered model includes the model's output directory. When you log and register an MLflow model, you can find the `MLmodel` file in the artifacts of the registered model.

### Log and register models with MLflow

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. When you log models with MLflow, you can easily move the model across platforms and workloads.

In this exercise, you’ll use MLflow to log machine learning models.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to run a command job.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute instance, and a compute cluster, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/10
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Submit MLflow jobs from a notebook

Now that you have all the necessary resources, you can run the notebook to train and log models with MLflow.

1. Open the **Labs\10\Log models with MLflow.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Create and explore the Responsible AI dashboard for a model in Azure Machine Learning

### Introduction

When you train a machine learning model, you may experiment with multiple models to find the one that best fits your data. To compare and evaluate models, you can review relevant performance metrics. Next to the performance metrics, you should also review whether your models conform to **responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI)** principles. Responsible AI is an approach to developing, assessing, and deploying models in a safe, trustworthy, and ethical way.

To help you with implementing responsible AI, Azure Machine Learning offers the **Responsible AI dashboard**. You can create and customize the Responsible AI dashboard to explore your data and model.

### Understand Responsible AI

As a data scientist, you may train a machine learning model to predict whether someone is able to pay back a loan, or whether a candidate is suitable for a job vacancy. As models are often used when making decisions, it's important that the models are unbiased and transparent.

Whatever you use a model for, you should consider the **Responsible Artificial Intelligence** (**Responsible AI**) principles. Depending on the use case, you may focus on specific principles. Nevertheless, it's a best practice to consider all principles to ensure you're addressing any issues the model may have.

Microsoft has listed five Responsible AI principles:

- **Fairness and inclusiveness**: Models should treat everyone fairly and avoid different treatment for similar groups.
- **Reliability and safety**: Models should be reliable, safe, and consistent. You want a model to operate as intended, handle unexpected situations well, and resist harmful manipulation.
- **Privacy and security**: Be transparent about data collection, use, and storage, to empower individuals with control over their data. Treat data with care to ensure an individual's privacy.
- **Transparency**: When models influence important decisions that affect people's lives, people need to understand how those decisions were made and how the model works.
- **Accountability**: Take accountability for decisions that models may influence and maintain human control.

>**Tip**: Learn about the [Responsible AI Standard](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf) for building AI systems according to the six key principles.

### Create the Responsible AI dashboard
To help you implement the **Responsible Artificial Intelligence** (**Responsible AI**) principles in Azure Machine Learning, you can create the **Responsible AI dashboard**.

The Responsible AI dashboard allows you to pick and choose insights you need, to evaluate whether your model is safe, trustworthy, and ethical.

Azure Machine Learning has built-in **components** that can generate Responsible AI insights for you. The insights are then gathered in an interactive dashboard for you to explore. You can also generate a scorecard as PDF to easily share the insights with your colleagues to evaluate your models.

#### Create a Responsible AI dashboard

To create a Responsible AI (RAI) dashboard, you need to create a **pipeline** by using the built-in components. The pipeline should:

1. Start with the `RAI Insights dashboard constructor`.
2. Include one of the **RAI tool components**.
3. End with `Gather RAI Insights dashboard` to collect all insights into one dashboard.
4. _Optionally_ you can also add the `Gather RAI Insights score card` at the end of your pipeline.

#### Explore the Responsible AI components

The available tool components and the insights you can use are:

- `Add Explanation to RAI Insights dashboard`: Interpret models by generating explanations. Explanations show how much features influence the prediction.
- `Add Causal to RAI Insights dashboard`: Use historical data to view the causal effects of features on outcomes.
- `Add Counterfactuals to RAI Insights dashboard`: Explore how a change in input would change the model's output.
- `Add Error Analysis to RAI Insights dashboard`: Explore the distribution of your data and identify erroneous subgroups of data.

#### Build and run the pipeline to create the Responsible AI dashboard

To create the Responsible AI dashboard, you build a pipeline with the components you selected. When you run the pipeline, a Responsible dashboard (and scorecard) is generated and associated with your model.

After you've trained and registered a model in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can create the Responsible AI dashboard in three ways:

- Using the Command Line Interface (CLI) extension for Azure Machine Learning.
- Using the Python Software Development Kit (SDK).
- Using the Azure Machine Learning studio for a no-code experience.

##### Using the Python SDK to build and run the pipeline

To generate a Responsible AI dashboard, you need to:

- Register the training and test datasets as MLtable data assets.
- Register the model.
- Retrieve the built-in components you want to use.
- Build the pipeline.
- Run the pipeline.

If you want to build the pipeline using the Python SDK, you first have to retrieve the components you want to use.

You should start the pipeline with the `RAI Insights dashboard constructor` component:

```python
rai_constructor_component = ml_client_registry.components.get(
    name="microsoft_azureml_rai_tabular_insight_constructor", label="latest"
)
```

Then, you can add any of the available insights, like the explanations, by retrieving the `Add Explanation to RAI Insights dashboard component`:

```python
rai_explanation_component = ml_client_registry.components.get(
    name="microsoft_azureml_rai_tabular_explanation", label="latest"
)
```

>**Note**: The parameters and expected inputs vary across components. [Explore the component for the specific insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-responsible-ai-insights-sdk-cli?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python%3Fazure-portal%3Dtrue) you want to add to your dashboard to find which inputs you need to specify.

And finally, your pipeline should end with a `Gather RAI Insights dashboard` component:

```python
rai_gather_component = ml_client_registry.components.get(
    name="microsoft_azureml_rai_tabular_insight_gather", label="latest"
)
```

Once you have the components, you can build the pipeline:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import Input, dsl
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

@dsl.pipeline(
    compute="aml-cluster",
    experiment_name="Create RAI Dashboard",
)
def rai_decision_pipeline(
    target_column_name, train_data, test_data
):
    # Initiate the RAIInsights
    create_rai_job = rai_constructor_component(
        title="RAI dashboard diabetes",
        task_type="classification",
        model_info=expected_model_id,
        model_input=Input(type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL, path=azureml_model_id),
        train_dataset=train_data,
        test_dataset=test_data,
        target_column_name="Predictions",
    )
    create_rai_job.set_limits(timeout=30)

    # Add explanations
    explanation_job = rai_explanation_component(
        rai_insights_dashboard=create_rai_job.outputs.rai_insights_dashboard,
        comment="add explanation", 
    )
    explanation_job.set_limits(timeout=10)

    # Combine everything
    rai_gather_job = rai_gather_component(
        constructor=create_rai_job.outputs.rai_insights_dashboard,
        insight=explanation_job.outputs.explanation,
    )
    rai_gather_job.set_limits(timeout=10)

    rai_gather_job.outputs.dashboard.mode = "upload"

    return {
        "dashboard": rai_gather_job.outputs.dashboard,
    }

```

#### Exploring the Responsible AI dashboard

After building the pipeline, you need to run it to generate the Responsible AI dashboard. When the pipeline successfully completed, you can select to **view** the Responsible AI dashboard from the pipeline overview.

![Screenshot of completed pipeline to create Responsible AI dashboard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/manage-compare-models-azure-machine-learning/media/responsible-pipeline.png)

Alternatively, you can find the Responsible AI dashboard in the **Responsible AI** tab of the registered model.

![Screenshot of the Responsible AI tab of the registered model in the Azure Machine Learning studio.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/manage-compare-models-azure-machine-learning/media/responsible-model.png)
### Evaluate the Responsible AI dashboard

When your Responsible AI dashboard is generated, you can explore its contents in the Azure Machine Learning studio to evaluate your model.

When you open the Responsible AI dashboard, the studio tries to automatically connect it to a compute instance. The compute instance provides the necessary compute for interactive exploration within the dashboard.

The output of each component you added to the pipeline is reflected in the dashboard. Depending on the components you selected, you can find the following insights in your Responsible AI dashboard:

- Error analysis
- Explanations
- Counterfactuals
- Causal analysis

Let's explore what we can review for each of these insights.

##### Explore error analysis

A model is expected to make false predictions, or errors. With the error analysis feature in the Responsible AI dashboard, you can review and understand how errors are distributed in your dataset. For example, are there specific subgroups, or cohorts, in your dataset for which the model makes more false predictions?

When you include error analysis, there are two types of visuals you can explore in the Responsible AI dashboard:

- **Error tree map**: Allows you to explore which combination of subgroups results in the model making more false predictions.

- **Error heat map**: Presents a grid overview of a model's errors over the scale of one or two features.

![Screenshot of error heat map of diabetes classification model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/manage-compare-models-azure-machine-learning/media/error-map.png)

##### Explore explanations

Whenever you use a model for decision-making, you want to understand how a model reaches a certain prediction. Whenever you've trained a model that is too complex to understand, you can run _model explainers_ to calculate the **feature importance**. In other words, you want to understand how each of the input features influences the model's prediction.

There are [various statistical techniques](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-interpretability?view=azureml-api-2#supported-model-interpretability-techniques) you can use as model explainers. Most commonly, the **mimic** explainer trains a simple interpretable model on the same data and task. As a result, you can explore two types of feature importance:

- **Aggregate feature importance**: Shows how each feature in the test data influences the model's predictions _overall_.

![Screenshot of aggregate feature importance for diabetes dataset.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/manage-compare-models-azure-machine-learning/media/aggregate-feature.png)

- **Individual feature importance**: Shows how each feature impacts an _individual_ prediction.

![Screenshot of individual feature importance for one row in the diabetes dataset.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/manage-compare-models-azure-machine-learning/media/individual-feature.png)

##### Explore counterfactuals

Explanations can give you insights into the relative importance of features on the model's predictions. Sometimes, you may want to take it a step further and understand whether the model's predictions would change if the input would be different. To explore how the model's output would change based on a change in the input, you can use **counterfactuals**.

You can choose to explore counterfactuals _what-if_ examples by selecting a data point and the desired model's prediction for that point. When you create a what-if counterfactual, the dashboard opens a panel to help you understand which input would result in the desired prediction.

##### Explore causal analysis

Explanations and counterfactuals help you to understand the model's predictions and the effects of features on the predictions. Though model interpretability may already be a goal by itself, you may also need more information to help you improve decision-making.

**Causal analysis** uses statistical techniques to estimate the average effect of a feature on a desired prediction. It analyzes how certain interventions or treatments may result in a better outcome, across a population or for a specific individual.

There are three available tabs in the Responsible AI dashboard when including causal analysis:

- **Aggregate causal effects**: Shows the average causal effects for predefined treatment features (the features you want to change to optimize the model's predictions).
- **Individual causal effects**: Shows individual data points and allows you to change the treatment features to explore their influence on the prediction.
- **Treatment policy**: Shows which parts of your data points benefit most from a treatment.

### Create and explore the Responsible AI dashboard

After you train your model, you’ll want to evaluate your model to explore whether it’s performing as expected. Next to performance metrics, there are other factors you can take into consideration. The Responsible AI dashboard in Azure Machine Learning allows you to analyze the data and the model’s predictions to identify any bias or unfairness.

In this exercise, you’ll prepare your data and create a Responsible AI dashboard in Azure Machine Learning.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to run a command job.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute instance, and a compute cluster, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/10
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Create a pipeline to evaluate models and submit from a notebook

Now that you have all the necessary resources, you can run the notebook to retrieve the built-in responsible AI components, create a pipeline, and submit the pipeline to generate a responsible AI dashboard.

1. Open the **Labs/10/Create Responsible AI dashboard.ipynb** notebook.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

# Deploy and consume models with Azure Machine Learning
## Deploy a model to a managed online endpoint
### Introduction

Imagine you trained a model to recommend restaurants. The model has been trained and tracked in Azure Machine Learning. You want to use the model in your application where consumers can browse restaurants in their area. Each time a consumer selects a restaurant in the application, you want the model to recommend other restaurants that might also be of interest to the consumer to improve the user experience.

Whenever you train a model, you ultimately will want to consume the model. You want to use the trained model to predict labels for new data on which the model hasn't been trained.

To consume the model, you need to **deploy** it. One way to deploy a model is to integrate it with a service that allows applications to request instant, or **real-time**, predictions for individual or small sets of data points.

![Diagram showing an application requesting an instant prediction of a model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-managed-online-endpoint/media/07-01-real-time.jpg)

In Azure Machine Learning, you can use **online endpoints** to deploy and consume your model.
### Explore managed online endpoints

To make a machine learning model available for other applications, you can deploy the model to a managed online endpoint.

You'll learn how to use managed online endpoints for real-time predictions.

#### Real-time predictions

To get real-time predictions, you can deploy a model to an endpoint. An **endpoint** is an HTTPS endpoint to which you can send data, and which will return a response (almost) immediately.

Any data you send to the endpoint will serve as the input for the scoring script hosted on the endpoint. The scoring script loads the trained model to predict the label for the new input data, which is also called **inferencing**. The label is then part of the output that's returned.

#### Managed online endpoint

Within Azure Machine Learning, there are two types of online endpoints:

- **Managed online endpoints**: Azure Machine Learning manages all the underlying infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes online endpoints**: Users manage the Kubernetes cluster which provides the necessary infrastructure.

As a data scientist, you may prefer to work with managed online endpoints to test whether your model works as expected when deployed. If a Kubernetes online endpoint is required for control and scalability, it'll likely be managed by other teams.

If you're using a managed online endpoint, you only need to specify the virtual machine (VM) type and scaling settings. Everything else, such as provisioning compute power and updating the host operating system (OS) is done for you automatically.

#### Deploy your model

After you create an endpoint in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can deploy a model to that endpoint. To deploy your model to a managed online endpoint, you need to specify four things:

- **Model assets** like the model pickle file, or a **registered model** in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- **Scoring script** that loads the model.
- **Environment** which lists all necessary packages that need to be installed on the compute of the endpoint.
- **Compute configuration** including the needed **compute size** and **scale settings** to ensure you can handle the amount of requests the endpoint will receive.

>**Important**: When you deploy MLFlow models to an online endpoint, you don't need to provide a scoring script and environment, as both are automatically generated.

All of these elements are defined in the deployment. The deployment is essentially a set of resources needed to host the model that performs the actual inferencing.

#### Blue/green deployment

One endpoint can have multiple deployments. One approach is the **blue/green deployment**.

Let's take the example of the restaurant recommender model. After experimentation, you select the best performing model. You use the blue deployment for this first version of the model. As new data is collected, the model can be retrained, and a new version is registered in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. To test the new model, you can use the green deployment for the second version of the model.

Both versions of the model are deployed to the same endpoint, which is integrated with the application. Within the application, a user selects a restaurant, sending a request to the endpoint to get new real-time recommendations of other restaurants the user may like.

When a request is sent to the endpoint, 90% of the traffic can go to the blue deployment*, and 10% of the traffic can go to the _green deployment_. With two versions of the model deployed on the same endpoint, you can easily test the model.

After testing, you can also seamlessly transition to the new version of the model by redirecting 90% of the traffic to the green deployment. If it turns out that the new version doesn't perform better, you can easily roll back to the first version of the model by redirecting most of the traffic back to the blue deployment.

Blue/green deployment allows for multiple models to be deployed to an endpoint. You can decide how much traffic to forward to each deployed model. This way, you can switch to a new version of the model without interrupting service to the consumer.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [safe rollout for online endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-safely-rollout-online-endpoints)

#### Create an endpoint

To create an online endpoint, you'll use the `ManagedOnlineEndpoint` class, which requires the following parameters:

- `name`: Name of the endpoint. Must be unique in the Azure region.
- `auth_mode`: Use `key` for key-based authentication. Use `aml_token` for Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication.

To create an endpoint, use the following command:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineEndpoint

# create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
    name="endpoint-example",
    description="Online endpoint",
    auth_mode="key",
)

ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
```

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a managed online endpoint with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.managedonlineendpoint).

### Deploy your MLflow model to a managed online endpoint

The easiest way to deploy a model to an online endpoint is to use an **MLflow** model and deploy it to a _managed_ online endpoint. Azure Machine Learning will automatically generate the scoring script and environment for MLflow models.

To deploy an MLflow model, you need to have created an endpoint. Then you can deploy the model to the endpoint.

#### Deploy an MLflow model to an endpoint

When you deploy an MLflow model to a managed online endpoint, you don´t need to have the scoring script and environment.

To deploy an MLflow model, you must have model files stored on a local path or with a registered model. You can log model files when training a model by using MLflow tracking.

In this example, we're taking the model files from a local path. The files are all stored in a local folder called `model`. The folder must include the `MLmodel` file, which describes how the model can be loaded and used.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [the MLmodel format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow-models#the-mlmodel-format?azure-portal=true).

Next to the model, you also need to specify the compute configuration for the deployment:

- `instance_type`: Virtual machine (VM) size to use. [Review the list of supported sizes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list).
- `instance_count`: Number of instances to use.

To deploy (and automatically register) the model, run the following command:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model, ManagedOnlineDeployment
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

# create a blue deployment
model = Model(
    path="./model",
    type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL,
    description="my sample mlflow model",
)

blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="blue",
    endpoint_name="endpoint-example",
    model=model,
    instance_type="Standard_F4s_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)

ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment).result()
```

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a managed online deployment with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.managedonlinedeployment).

Since only one model is deployed to the endpoint, you want this model to take 100% of the traffic. When you deploy multiple models to the same endpoint, you can distribute the traffic among the deployed models.

To route traffic to a specific deployment, use the following code:

```python
# blue deployment takes 100 traffic
endpoint.traffic = {"blue": 100}
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
```

To delete the endpoint and all associated deployments, run the command:

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(name="endpoint-example")
```

>**Tip**: Learn more about [deploying MLflow models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models)

### Deploy a model to a managed online endpoint

You can choose to deploy a model to a managed online endpoint without using the MLflow model format. To deploy a model, you'll need to create the scoring script and define the environment necessary during inferencing.

To deploy a model, you need to have created an endpoint. Then you can deploy the model to the endpoint.

#### Deploy a model to an endpoint

To deploy a model, you must have:

- Model files stored on local path or registered model.
- A scoring script.
- An execution environment.

The model files can be logged and stored when you train a model.

##### Create the scoring script

The scoring script needs to include two functions:

- `init()`: Called when the service is initialized.
- `run()`: Called when new data is submitted to the service.

The **init** function is called when the deployment is created or updated, to load and cache the model from the model registry. The **run** function is called for every time the endpoint is invoked, to generate predictions from the input data. The following example Python script shows this pattern:

```python
import json
import joblib
import numpy as np
import os

# called when the deployment is created or updated
def init():
    global model
    # get the path to the registered model file and load it
    model_path = os.path.join(os.getenv('AZUREML_MODEL_DIR'), 'model.pkl')
    model = joblib.load(model_path)

# called when a request is received
def run(raw_data):
    # get the input data as a numpy array
    data = np.array(json.loads(raw_data)['data'])
    # get a prediction from the model
    predictions = model.predict(data)
    # return the predictions as any JSON serializable format
    return predictions.tolist()
```

##### Create an environment

Your deployment requires an execution environment in which to run the scoring script.

You can create an environment with a Docker image with Conda dependencies, or with a Dockerfile.

To create an environment using a base Docker image, you can define the Conda dependencies in a `conda.yml` file:

```yml
name: basic-env-cpu
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
```

Then, to create the environment, run the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    conda_file="./src/conda.yml",
    name="deployment-environment",
    description="Environment created from a Docker image plus Conda environment.",
)
ml_client.environments.create_or_update(env)
```

##### Create the deployment

When you have your model files, scoring script, and environment, you can create the deployment.

To deploy a model to an endpoint, you can specify the compute configuration with two parameters:

- `instance_type`: Virtual machine (VM) size to use. [Review the list of supported sizes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list).
- `instance_count`: Number of instances to use.

To deploy the model, use the `ManagedOnlineDeployment` class and run the following command:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineDeployment, CodeConfiguration

model = Model(path="./model",

blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="blue",
    endpoint_name="endpoint-example",
    model=model,
    environment="deployment-environment",
    code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
        code="./src", scoring_script="score.py"
    ),
    instance_type="Standard_DS2_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)

ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment).result()
```

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a managed online deployment with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.managedonlinedeployment).

You can deploy multiple models to an endpoint. To route traffic to a specific deployment, use the following code:

```python
# blue deployment takes 100 traffic
endpoint.traffic = {"blue": 100}
ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
```

To delete the endpoint and all associated deployments, run the command:

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(name="endpoint-example")
```
### Test managed online endpoints

After deploying a real-time service, you can consume it from client applications to predict labels for new data cases.

#### Use the Azure Machine Learning studio

You can list all endpoints in the Azure Machine Learning studio, by navigating to the **Endpoints** page. In the **Real-time endpoints** tab, all endpoints are shown.

You can select an endpoint to review its details and deployment logs.

Additionally, you can use the studio to test the endpoint.

![Diagram showing different hyperparameter values resulting in different models by performing hyperparameter tuning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-managed-online-endpoint/media/test-studio.png)

#### Use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK

For testing, you can also use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK to invoke an endpoint.

Typically, you send data to deployed model in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data":[
      [0.1,2.3,4.1,2.0], // 1st case
      [0.2,1.8,3.9,2.1],  // 2nd case,
      ...
  ]
}
```

The response from the deployed model is a JSON collection with a prediction for each case that was submitted in the data. The following code sample invokes an endpoint and displays the response:

```python
# test the blue deployment with some sample data
response = ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
    deployment_name="blue",
    request_file="sample-data.json",
)

if response[1]=='1':
    print("Yes")
else:
    print ("No")
```

### Deploy a model to a managed online endpoint

To consume a model in an application, and get real-time predictions, you’ll want to deploy the model to a managed online endpoint. An MLflow model is easily deployed since you won’t need to define the environment or create the scoring script.

## Deploy a model to a batch endpoint
### Introduction

Imagine you trained a model to predict the product sales. The model has been trained and tracked in Azure Machine Learning. Every month, you want to use the model to forecast the sales for the upcoming month.

In many production scenarios, long-running tasks that deal with large amounts of data are performed as **batch** operations. In machine learning, _**batch inferencing**_ is used to asynchronously apply a predictive model to multiple cases and write the results to a file or database.

![Diagram showing a batch inferencing service triggering a batch scoring job.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-batch-endpoint/media/07-02-batch.png)

In Azure Machine Learning, you can implement batch inferencing solutions by deploying a model to a batch endpoint.

### Understand and create batch endpoints

To get a model to generate batch predictions, you can deploy the model to a batch endpoint.

You'll learn how to use batch endpoints for asynchronous batch scoring.

#### Batch predictions

To get batch predictions, you can deploy a model to an endpoint. An **endpoint** is an HTTPS endpoint that you can call to trigger a batch scoring job. The advantage of such an endpoint is that you can trigger the batch scoring job from another service, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Databricks. A batch endpoint allows you to integrate the batch scoring with an existing data ingestion and transformation pipeline.

Whenever the endpoint is invoked, a batch scoring job is submitted to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. The job typically uses a **compute cluster** to score multiple inputs. The results can be stored in a datastore, connected to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

#### Create a batch endpoint

To deploy a model to a batch endpoint, you'll first have to create the batch endpoint.

To create a batch endpoint, you'll use the `BatchEndpoint` class. Batch endpoint names need to be unique within an Azure region.

To create an endpoint, use the following command:

```python
# create a batch endpoint
endpoint = BatchEndpoint(
    name="endpoint-example",
    description="A batch endpoint",
)

ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint)
```

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a batch endpoint with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.batchendpoint).

#### Deploy a model to a batch endpoint

You can deploy multiple models to a batch endpoint. Whenever you call the batch endpoint, which triggers a batch scoring job, the **default deployment** will be used unless specified otherwise.

![Screenshot of details page of a batch endpoint, showing the default deployment.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-batch-endpoint/media/batch-details.png)

#### Use compute clusters for batch deployments

The ideal compute to use for batch deployments is the Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. If you want the batch scoring job to process the new data in parallel batches, you need to provision a compute cluster with more than one maximum instances.

To create a compute cluster, you can use the `AMLCompute` class.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

cpu_cluster = AmlCompute(
    name="aml-cluster",
    type="amlcompute",
    size="STANDARD_DS11_V2",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=4,
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120,
    tier="Dedicated",
)

cpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.begin_create_or_update(cpu_cluster)
```

### Deploy your MLflow model to a batch endpoint

An easy way to deploy a model to a batch endpoint is to use an **MLflow** model. Azure Machine Learning will automatically generate the scoring script and environment for MLflow models.

To deploy an MLflow model, you need to have created an endpoint. Then you can deploy the model to the endpoint.

#### Register an MLflow model

To avoid needed a scoring script and environment, an MLflow model needs to be registered in the Azure Machine Learning workspace before you can deploy it to a batch endpoint.

To register an MLflow model, you'll use the `Model` class, while specifying the model type to be `MLFLOW_MODEL`. To register the model with the Python SDK, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

model_name = 'mlflow-model'
model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
    Model(name=model_name, path='./model', type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL)
)
```

In this example, we're taking the model files from a local path. The files are all stored in a local folder called `model`. The folder must include the `MLmodel` file, which describes how the model can be loaded and used.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [the MLmodel format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow-models#the-mlmodel-format?azure-portal=true).

#### Deploy an MLflow model to an endpoint

To deploy an MLflow model to a batch endpoint, you'll use the `BatchDeployment` class.

When you deploy a model, you'll need to specify how you want the batch scoring job to behave. The advantage of using a compute cluster to run the scoring script (which is automatically generated by Azure Machine Learning), is that you can run the scoring script on separate instances in parallel.

When you configure the model deployment, you can specify:

- `instance_count`: Count of compute nodes to use for generating predictions.
- `max_concurrency_per_instance`: Maximum number of parallel scoring script runs per compute node.
- `mini_batch_size`: Number of files passed per scoring script run.
- `output_action`: What to do with the predictions: `summary_only` or `append_row`.
- `output_file_name`: File to which predictions will be appended, if you choose `append_row` for `output_action`.

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a batch deployment with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.batchdeployment).

To deploy an MLflow model to a batch endpoint, you can use the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import BatchDeployment, BatchRetrySettings
from azure.ai.ml.constants import BatchDeploymentOutputAction

deployment = BatchDeployment(
    name="forecast-mlflow",
    description="A sales forecaster",
    endpoint_name=endpoint.name,
    model=model,
    compute="aml-cluster",
    instance_count=2,
    max_concurrency_per_instance=2,
    mini_batch_size=2,
    output_action=BatchDeploymentOutputAction.APPEND_ROW,
    output_file_name="predictions.csv",
    retry_settings=BatchRetrySettings(max_retries=3, timeout=300),
    logging_level="info",
)
ml_client.batch_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment)
```
### Deploy a custom model to a batch endpoint

If you want to deploy a model to a batch endpoint without using the MLflow model format, you need to create the scoring script and environment.

To deploy a model, you must have already created an endpoint. Then you can deploy the model to the endpoint.

#### Create the scoring script

The scoring script is a file that reads the new data, loads the model, and performs the scoring.

The scoring script must include two functions:

- `init()`: Called once at the beginning of the process, so use for any costly or common preparation like loading the model.
- `run()`: Called for each mini batch to perform the scoring.

The `run()` method should return a pandas DataFrame or an array/list.

A scoring script may look as follows:

```python
import os
import mlflow
import pandas as pd


def init():
    global model

    # get the path to the registered model file and load it
    model_path = os.path.join(os.environ["AZUREML_MODEL_DIR"], "model")
    model = mlflow.pyfunc.load(model_path)


def run(mini_batch):
    print(f"run method start: {__file__}, run({len(mini_batch)} files)")
    resultList = []

    for file_path in mini_batch:
        data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        pred = model.predict(data)

        df = pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=["predictions"])
        df["file"] = os.path.basename(file_path)
        resultList.extend(df.values)

    return resultList
```

There are some things to note from the example script:

- `AZUREML_MODEL_DIR` is an environment variable that you can use to locate the files associated with the model.
- Use `global` variable to make any assets available that are needed to score the new data, like the loaded model.
- The size of the `mini_batch` is defined in the deployment configuration. If the files in the mini batch are too large to be processed, you need to split the files into smaller files.
- By default, the predictions will be written to one single file.

>**Tip**: Learn more about how to [author scoring scripts for batch deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/batch-inference/how-to-batch-scoring-script).

#### Create an environment

Your deployment requires an execution environment in which to run the scoring script. Any dependency your code requires should be included in the environment.

You can create an environment with a Docker image with Conda dependencies, or with a Dockerfile.

You'll also need to add the library `azureml-core` as it is required for batch deployments to work.

To create an environment using a base Docker image, you can define the Conda dependencies in a `conda.yaml` file:

```yml
name: basic-env-cpu
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pandas
  - pip
  - pip:
      - azureml-core
      - mlflow
```

Then, to create the environment, run the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
    conda_file="./src/conda-env.yml",
    name="deployment-environment",
    description="Environment created from a Docker image plus Conda environment.",
)
ml_client.environments.create_or_update(env)
```

#### Configure and create the deployment

Finally, you can configure and create the deployment with the `BatchDeployment` class.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import BatchDeployment, BatchRetrySettings
from azure.ai.ml.constants import BatchDeploymentOutputAction

deployment = BatchDeployment(
    name="forecast-mlflow",
    description="A sales forecaster",
    endpoint_name=endpoint.name,
    model=model,
    compute="aml-cluster",
    code_path="./code",
    scoring_script="score.py",
    environment=env,
    instance_count=2,
    max_concurrency_per_instance=2,
    mini_batch_size=2,
    output_action=BatchDeploymentOutputAction.APPEND_ROW,
    output_file_name="predictions.csv",
    retry_settings=BatchRetrySettings(max_retries=3, timeout=300),
    logging_level="info",
)
ml_client.batch_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment)
```

>**Tip**: Explore the reference documentation to [create a batch deployment with the Python SDK v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.batchdeployment).

### Invoke and troubleshoot batch endpoints

When you invoke a batch endpoint, you trigger an Azure Machine Learning **pipeline job**. The job will expect an input parameter pointing to the data set you want to score.

#### Trigger the batch scoring job

To prepare data for batch predictions, you can register a folder as a data asset in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

You can then use the registered data asset as input when invoking the batch endpoint with the Python SDK:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import Input
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

input = Input(type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER, path="azureml:new-data:1")

job = ml_client.batch_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint.name, 
    input=input)
```

You can monitor the run of the pipeline job in the Azure Machine Learning studio. All jobs that are triggered by invoking the batch endpoint will show in the **Jobs** tab of the batch endpoint.

![Screenshot of completed and failed jobs from an invoked batch endpoint.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-batch-endpoint/media/batch-jobs.png)

The predictions will be stored in the default datastore.

#### Troubleshoot a batch scoring job

The batch scoring job runs as a _pipeline job_. If you want to troubleshoot the pipeline job, you can review its details and the outputs and logs of the pipeline job itself.

![Screenshot of child job under the pipeline job overview.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-batch-endpoint/media/child-job.png)

If you want to troubleshoot the scoring script, you can select the child job and review its outputs and logs.

Navigate to the **Outputs + logs** tab. The **logs/user/** folder contains three files that will help you troubleshoot:

- `job_error.txt`: Summarize the errors in your script.
- `job_progress_overview.txt`: Provides high-level information about the number of mini-batches processed so far.
- `job_result.txt`: Shows errors in calling the `init()` and `run()` function in the scoring script.

![Screenshot of the output and logs of the child job.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/deploy-model-batch-endpoint/media/child-output.png)
### Deploy a model to a batch endpoint

In many scenarios, inferencing is performed as a batch process that uses a predictive model to score a large number of cases. To implement this kind of inferencing solution in Azure Machine Learning, you can create a batch endpoint.

In this exercise, you’ll deploy an MLflow model to a batch endpoint, and test it on sample data by submitting a job.

#### Before you start

You’ll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative-level access.

#### Provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace

An Azure Machine Learning _workspace_ provides a central place for managing all resources and assets you need to train and manage your models. You can interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace through the studio, Python SDK, and Azure CLI.

You’ll use the Azure CLI to provision the workspace and necessary compute, and you’ll use the Python SDK to run a command job.

##### Create the workspace and compute resources

To create the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute instance, and a compute cluster, you’ll use the Azure CLI. All necessary commands are grouped in a Shell script for you to execute.

1. In a browser, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Select the [>_] (_Cloud Shell_) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal.
3. Select **Bash** if asked. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be asked to choose the type of shell you want to use (_Bash_ or _PowerShell_).
4. Check that the correct subscription is specified and that **No storage account required** is selected. Select **Apply**.
5. In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repo:
    
    ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
    > Use `SHIFT + INSERT` to paste your copied code into the Cloud Shell.
    
6. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.sh** script it contains:
    
    ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/11
     ./setup.sh
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
    
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5-10 minutes.
    
    **Troubleshooting tip**: Workspace creation error  
    

#### Clone the lab materials

When you’ve created the workspace and necessary compute resources, you can open the Azure Machine Learning studio and clone the lab materials into the workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **mlw-dp100-…**.
2. Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and in its **Overview** page, select **Launch studio**. Another tab will open in your browser to open the Azure Machine Learning studio.
3. Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.
4. Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created in the previous section exist. The compute instance should be running, the cluster should be idle and have 0 nodes running.
5. In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
6. In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```
    
    > Ignore any (error) messages that say that the packages couldn’t be found and uninstalled.
    
7. Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing a notebook, data, and other files to your workspace:
    
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
    ```
    
8. When the command has completed, in the **Files** pane, click **↻** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/_your-user-name_/azure-ml-labs** folder has been created.

#### Deploy a model to an batch endpoint

The code to create the endpoint and deploy an MLflow model with the Python SDK is provided in a notebook.

1. Open the **Labs/11/Deploy to batch endpoint.ipynb** notebook.
    
    > Select **Authenticate** and follow the necessary steps if a notification appears asking you to authenticate.
    
2. Verify that the notebook uses the **Python 3.10 - AzureML** kernel.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

#### Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **rg-dp100-…** resource group.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

# Develop generative AI apps in Azure
## Plan and prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure
### Introduction

The growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in general, and _generative_ AI in particular means that developers are increasingly required to create comprehensive AI solutions. These solutions need to combine machine learning models, AI services, prompt engineering solutions, and custom code.

Microsoft Azure provides multiple services that you can use to create AI solutions. However, before embarking on an AI application development project, it's useful to consider the available options for services, tools, and frameworks as well as some principles and practices that can help you succeed.
### What is AI?

The term "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) covers a wide range of software capabilities that enable applications to exhibit human-like behavior. AI has been around for many years, and its definition has varied as the technology and use cases associated with it have evolved. In today's technological landscape, AI solutions are built on machine learning _models_ that encapsulate semantic relationships found in huge quantities of data; enabling applications to appear to interpret input in various formats, reason over the input data, and generate appropriate responses and predictions.

Common AI capabilities that developers can integrate into a software application include:

|Capability|Description|
|---|---|
|![Diagram of speech bubbles.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/generative-ai.png)  <br>**Generative AI**|The ability to generate original responses to natural language _prompts_. For example, software for a real estate business might be used to automatically generate property descriptions and advertising copy for a property listing.|
|![Diagram of a human head with a cog for a brain.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/agent.png)  <br>**Agents**|Generative AI applications that can respond to user input or assess situations autonomously, and take appropriate actions. For example, an "executive assistant" agent could provide details about the location of a meeting on your calendar, or even attach a map or automate the booking of a taxi or rideshare service to help you get there.|
|![Diagram of an eye being scanned.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/computer-vision.png)  <br>**Computer vision**|The ability to accept, interpret, and process visual input from images, videos, and live camera streams. For example, an automated checkout in a grocery store might use computer vision to identify which products a customer has in their shopping basket, eliminating the need to scan a barcode or manually enter the product and quantity.|
|![Diagram of a speech bubble and a sound wave.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/speech.png)  <br>**Speech**|The ability to recognize and synthesize speech. For example, a digital assistant might enable users to ask questions or provide audible instructions by speaking into a microphone, and generate spoken output to provide answers or confirmations.|
|![Diagram of a text document.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/natural-language.png)  <br>**Natural language processing**|The ability to process natural language in written or spoken form, analyze it, identify key points, and generate summaries or categorizations. For example, a marketing application might analyze social media messages that mention a particular company, translate them to a specific language, and categorize them as positive or negative based on sentiment analysis.|
|![Diagram of a form containing information.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/information-extraction.png)  <br>**Information extraction**|The ability to use computer vision, speech, and natural language processing to extract key information from documents, forms, images, recordings, and other kinds of content. For example, an automated expense claims processing application might extract purchase dates, individual line item details, and total costs from a scanned receipt.|
|![Diagram of a chart showing an upward trend.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/prediction.png)  <br>**Decision support**|The ability to use historic data and learned correlations to make predictions that support business decision making. For example, analyzing demographic and economic factors in a city to predict real estate market trends that inform property pricing decisions.|

Determining the specific AI capabilities you want to include in your application can help you identify the most appropriate AI services that you'll need to provision, configure, and use in your solution.

#### A closer look at generative AI

_Generative AI_ represents the latest advance in artificial intelligence, and deserves some extra attention. Generative AI uses _language models_ to respond to natural language _prompts_, enabling you to build conversational apps and agents that support research, content creation, and task automation in ways that were previously unimaginable.

![Diagram of a prompt, a language model, and a response.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/prompt.png)

The language models used in generative AI solutions can be large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on huge volumes of data and include many millions of parameters; or they can be small language models (SLMs) that are optimized for specific scenarios with lower overhead. Language models commonly respond to text-based prompts with natural language text; though increasingly new _multi-modal_ models are able to handle image or speech prompts and respond by generating text, code, speech, or images.
### Azure AI services

Microsoft Azure provides a wide range of cloud services that you can use to develop, deploy, and manage an AI solution. The most obvious starting point for considering AI development on Azure is Azure AI services; a set of out-of-the-box prebuilt APIs and models that you can integrate into your applications. The following table lists some commonly used Azure AI services (for a full list of all available Azure AI services, see [Available Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services#available-azure-ai-services?azure-portal=true)).

AI Search is commonly used to create vector indexes for data that can then be used to _ground_ prompts submitted to generative AI language models, such as those provided in Azure OpenAI.|

#### Considerations for Azure AI services resources

To use Azure AI services, you create one or more Azure AI resources in an Azure subscription and implement code in client applications to consume them. In some cases, AI services include web-based visual interfaces that you can use to configure and test your resources - for example to train a custom image classification model using the **Custom Vision** service you can use the visual interface to upload training images, manage training jobs, and deploy the resulting model.

>**Note**: You can provision Azure AI services resources in the Azure portal (or by using BICEP or ARM templates or the Azure command-line interface) and build applications that use them directly through various service-specific APIs and SDKs. However, as we'll discuss later in this module, in most medium to large-scale development scenarios it's better to provision Azure AI services resources as part of an _Azure AI Foundry_ project - enabling you to centralize access control and cost management, and making it easier to manage shared resources and build the next generation of generative AI apps and agents.

##### Single service or multi-service resource?

Most Azure AI services, such as **Azure AI Vision**, **Azure AI Language**, and so on, can be provisioned as standalone resources, enabling you to create only the Azure resources you specifically need. Additionally, standalone Azure AI services often include a free-tier SKU with limited functionality, enabling you to evaluate and develop with the service at no cost. Each standalone Azure AI resource provides an endpoint and authorization keys that you can use to access it securely from a client application.

Alternatively, you can provision a multi-service resource that encapsulates multiple AI services in a single Azure resource. Using a multi-service resource can make it easier to manage applications that use multiple AI capabilities. There are two multi-service resource types you can use:

|Resource|Description|
|---|---|
|![Azure AI service icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/cognitive-services.png)  <br>**Azure AI services**|The Azure AI Services resource type includes the following services, making them available from a single endpoint:<br><br>- Azure AI Speech<br>- Azure AI Language<br>- Azure AI Translator<br>- Azure AI Vision<br>- Azure AI Face<br>- Azure AI Custom Vision<br>- Azure AI Document Intelligence|
|![Azure AI Foundry icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/ai-services.png)  <br>**Azure AI Foundry**|The Azure AI Foundry resource type includes the following services, and supports working with them through an Azure AI Foundry project*:<br><br>- Azure OpenAI<br>- Azure AI Speech<br>- Azure AI Language<br>- Azure AI Foundry Content Safety<br>- Azure AI Translator<br>- Azure AI Vision<br>- Azure AI Face<br>- Azure AI Document Intelligence<br>- Azure AI Content Understanding|


##### Regional availability

Some services and models are available in only a subset of Azure regions. Consider service availability and any regional quota restrictions for your subscription when provisioning Azure AI services. Use the [product availability table](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) to check regional availability of Azure services. Use the [model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability?azure-portal=true) in the Azure OpenAI documentation to determine regional availability for Azure OpenAI models.

##### Cost

Azure AI services are charged based on usage, with different pricing schemes available depending on the specific services being used. As you plan an AI solution on Azure, use the [Azure AI services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services) documentation to understand pricing for the AI services you intend to incorporate into your application. You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the costs your expected usage will incur.
### Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry is a platform for AI development on Microsoft Azure. While you _can_ provision individual Azure AI services resources and build applications that consume them without it, the project organization, resource management, and AI development capabilities of Azure AI Foundry makes it the recommended way to build all but the most simple solutions.

Azure AI Foundry provides the _Azure AI Foundry portal_, a web-based visual interface for working with AI projects. It also provides the _Azure AI Foundry SDK_, which you can use to build AI solutions programmatically.

#### Azure AI Foundry projects

In Azure AI Foundry, you manage the resource connections, data, code, and other elements of the AI solution in _projects_. There are two kinds of project:

##### Foundry projects

![Diagram of a Foundry project.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/foundry-project.png)

_Foundry projects_ are associated with an **Azure AI Foundry** resource in an Azure subscription. Foundry projects provide support for Azure AI Foundry models (including OpenAI models), Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, Azure AI services, and tools for evaluation and responsible AI development.

An Azure AI Foundry resource supports the most common AI development tasks to develop generative AI chat apps and agents. In most cases, using a Foundry project provides the right level of resource centralization and capabilities with a minimal amount of administrative resource management. You can use Azure AI Foundry portal to work in projects that are based in Azure AI Foundry resources, making it easy to add connected resources and manage model and agent deployments.

##### Hub-based projects

![Diagram of a hub-based project.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/hub-project.png)

_Hub-based projects_ are associated with an **Azure AI hub** resource in an Azure subscription. Hub-based projects include an Azure AI Foundry resource, as well as managed compute, support for Prompt Flow development, and connected **Azure storage** and **Azure key vault** resources for secure data storage.

Azure AI hub resources support advanced AI development scenarios, like developing Prompt Flow based applications or fine-tuning models. You can also use Azure AI hub resources in both Azure AI Foundry portal and Azure Machine learning portal, making it easier to work on collaborative projects that involve data scientists and machine learning specialists as well as developers and AI software engineers

>**Tip**: For more information about Azure AI Foundry project types, see **[What is Azure AI Foundry?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry)**.

### Developer tools and SDKs

While you can perform many of the tasks needed to develop an AI solution directly in the Azure AI Foundry portal, developers also need to write, test, and deploy code.

#### Development tools and environments

There are many development tools and environments available, and developers should choose one that supports the languages, SDKs, and APIs they need to work with and with which they're most comfortable. For example, a developer who focuses strongly on building applications for Windows using the .NET Framework might prefer to work in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Microsoft Visual Studio. Conversely, a web application developer who works with a wide range of open-source languages and libraries might prefer to use a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Both of these products are suitable for developing AI applications on Azure.

##### The Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension

When developing Azure AI Foundry based generative AI applications in Visual Studio Code, you can use the Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension to simplify key tasks in the workflow, including:

- Creating a project.
- Selecting and deploying a model.
- Testing a model in the playground.
- Creating an agent.

![Screenshot of the Azure AI Foundry Visual Studio Code extension.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/vs-code.png)

>**Tip**: For more information about using the Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension, see **[Work with the Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/get-started-projects-vs-code)**.

##### GitHub and GitHub Copilot

GitHub is the world's most popular platform for source control and DevOps management, and can be a critical element of any team development effort. Visual Studio and VS Code both provide native integration with GitHub, and access to GitHub Copilot; an AI assistant that can significantly improve developer productivity and effectiveness.

![Screenshot of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/github-copilot.png)

>**Tip**: For more information about using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, see **[GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)**.

#### Programming languages, APIs, and SDKs

You can develop AI applications using many common programming languages and frameworks, including Microsoft C#, Python, Node, TypeScript, Java, and others. When building AI solutions on Azure, some common SDKs you should plan to install and use include:

- The **[Azure AI Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/sdk-overview)**, which enables you to write code to connect to Azure AI Foundry projects and access resource connections, which you can then work with using service-specific SDKs.
- The **[Azure AI Foundry Models API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/modelinference/)**, which provides an interface for working with generative AI model endpoints hosted in Azure AI Foundry.
- The **[Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)**, which enables you to build chat applications based on OpenAI models hosted in Azure AI Foundry.
- **[Azure AI Services SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/reference/sdk-package-resources)** - AI service-specific libraries for multiple programming languages and frameworks that enable you to consume Azure AI Services resources in your subscription. You can also use Azure AI Services through their [REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/reference/rest-api-resources).
- The **[Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview)**, which is accessed through the Azure AI Foundry SDK and can be integrated with frameworks like [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview) to build comprehensive AI agent solutions.

### Responsible AI

It's important for software engineers to consider the impact of their software on users, and society in general; including considerations for its responsible use. When the application is imbued with artificial intelligence, these considerations are particularly important due to the nature of how AI systems work and inform decisions; often based on probabilistic models, which are in turn dependent on the data with which they were trained.

The human-like nature of AI solutions is a significant benefit in making applications user-friendly, but it can also lead users to place a great deal of trust in the application's ability to make correct decisions. The potential for harm to individuals or groups through incorrect predictions or misuse of AI capabilities is a major concern, and software engineers building AI-enabled solutions should apply due consideration to mitigate risks and ensure fairness, reliability, and adequate protection from harm or discrimination.

Let's discuss some core principles for responsible AI that have been adopted at Microsoft.

#### Fairness

![A diagram of scales.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/fairness.png)

AI systems should treat all people fairly. For example, suppose you create a machine learning model to support a loan approval application for a bank. The model should make predictions of whether or not the loan should be approved without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity, or other factors that might result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage to specific groups of applicants.

Fairness of machine learned systems is a highly active area of ongoing research, and some software solutions exist for evaluating, quantifying, and mitigating unfairness in machine learned models. However, tooling alone isn't sufficient to ensure fairness. Consider fairness from the beginning of the application development process; carefully reviewing training data to ensure it's representative of all potentially affected subjects, and evaluating predictive performance for subsections of your user population throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Reliability and safety

![A diagram of a shield.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/reliability-safety.png)

AI systems should perform reliably and safely. For example, consider an AI-based software system for an autonomous vehicle; or a machine learning model that diagnoses patient symptoms and recommends prescriptions. Unreliability in these kinds of system can result in substantial risk to human life.

As with any software, AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release. Additionally, software engineers need to take into account the probabilistic nature of machine learning models, and apply appropriate thresholds when evaluating confidence scores for predictions.

#### Privacy and security

![A diagram of a padlock.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/privacy-security.png)

AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. Even after models are trained and the system is in production, they use new data to make predictions or take action that may be subject to privacy or security concerns; so appropriate safeguards to protect data and customer content must be implemented.

#### Inclusiveness

![A diagram of a diverse group of people.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/inclusiveness.png)

AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.

One way to optimize for inclusiveness is to ensure that the design, development, and testing of your application includes input from as diverse a group of people as possible.

#### Transparency

![A diagram of an eye.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/transparency.png)

AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

For example, when an AI system is based on a machine learning model, you should generally make users aware of factors that may affect the accuracy of its predictions, such as the number of cases used to train the model, or the specific features that have the most influence over its predictions. You should also share information about the confidence score for predictions.

When an AI application relies on personal data, such as a facial recognition system that takes images of people to recognize them; you should make it clear to the user how their data is used and retained, and who has access to it.

#### Accountability

![A diagram of a handshake.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-azure-ai-development/media/accountability.png)

People should be accountable for AI systems. Although many AI systems seem to operate autonomously, ultimately it's the responsibility of the developers who trained and validated the models they use, and defined the logic that bases decisions on model predictions to ensure that the overall system meets responsibility requirements. To help meet this goal, designers and developers of AI-based solution should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets responsible and legal standards that are clearly defined.

>**Tip**: For more information about Microsoft's principles for responsible AI, see **[the Microsoft responsible AI site](https://microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai)**.

## Choose and deploy models from the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal
### Introduction

Generative AI applications are built on _language models_. The development process usually starts with an exploration and comparison of available _foundation_ models to find the one that best suits the particular needs of your application. After selecting a suitable model, you deploy it to an endpoint where it can be consumed by a client application or AI agent.

Foundation models, such as the GPT family of models, are state-of-the-art language models designed to understand, generate, and interact with natural language. Some common use cases for models are:

- **Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion**. For example, generate subtitles for videos.
- **Machine translation**. For example, translate text from English to Japanese.
- **Text classification**. For example, label an email as spam or not spam.
- **Entity extraction**. For example, extract keywords or names from a document.
- **Text summarization**. For example, generate a short one-paragraph summary from a multi-page document.
- **Question answering**. For example, provide answers to questions like "What is the capital of France?"
- **Reasoning**. For example, solve a mathematical problem.

In this module, you focus on exploring foundation models used for question answering. The foundation models you explore can be used for chat applications in which you use a language model to generate a response to a user's question.

>**Note**: The latest breakthrough in generative AI models is owed to the development of the **Transformer** architecture. Transformers were introduced in the [_Attention is all you need_ paper by Vaswani, et al. from 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The Transformer architecture provided two innovations to NLP that resulted in the emergence of foundation models:

- Instead of processing words sequentially, Transformers process each word independently and in parallel by using **attention**.
- Next to the semantic similarity between words, Transformers use **positional encoding** to include the information about the position of a word in a sentence.

### Explore the model catalog

The _model catalog_ in Azure AI Foundry provides a central repository of models that you can browse to find the right language model for your particular generative AI use case.

![Screenshot of the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-models-azure-ai-studio/media/model-catalog.png)

Selecting a foundation model for your generative AI app is important as it affects how well your app works. To find the best model for your app, you can use a structured approach by asking yourself the following questions:

- Can AI _solve_ my use case?
- How do I _select_ the best model for my use case?
- Can I _scale_ for real-world workloads?

Let's explore each of these questions.

#### Can AI _solve_ my use case?

Nowadays we have thousands of language models to choose from. The main challenge is to understand if there's a model that satisfies your needs and to answer the question: _Can AI solve my use case?_

To start answering this question, you need to discover, filter, and deploy a model. You can explore the available language models through three different catalogs:

- [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/models): Vast catalog of open-source models across various domains.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/marketplace/models-github): Access to diverse models via GitHub Marketplace and GitHub Copilot.
- [**Azure AI Foundry**](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models): Comprehensive catalog with robust tools for deployment.

Though you can use each of these catalogs to explore models, the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry makes it easiest to explore and deploy a model to build you prototype, while offering the best selection of models.

Let's explore some of the options you need to consider when searching for suitable models.

##### Choose between large and small language models

First of all, you have a choice between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs).

- LLMs like GPT-4, Mistral Large, Llama3 70B, Llama 405B, and Command R+ are powerful AI models designed for tasks that require deep reasoning, complex content generation, and extensive context understanding.
    
- SLMs like Phi3, Mistral OSS models, and Llama3 8B are efficient and cost-effective, while still handling many common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. They're perfect for running on lower-end hardware or edge devices, where cost and speed are more important than model complexity.
    

##### Focus on a modality, task, or tool

Language models like GPT-4 and Mistral Large are also known as **chat completion** models, designed to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text-based responses. When you need higher levels of performance in complex tasks like math, coding, science, strategy, and logistics, you can also use **reasoning** models like DeepSeek-R1 and o1.

Beyond text-based AI, some models are **multi-modal**, meaning they can process images, audio, and other data types alongside text. Models like GPT-4o and Phi3-vision are capable of analyzing and generating both text and images. Multi-modal models are useful when your application needs to process and understand images, such as in computer vision or document analysis. Or when you want to build an AI app that interacts with visual content, such as a digital tutor explaining images or charts.

If your use case involves **generating images**, tools like DALL·E 3 and Stability AI can create realistic visuals from text prompts. Image generation models are great for designing marketing materials, illustrations, or digital art.

Another group of task-specific models are **embedding models** like Ada and Cohere. Embeddings models convert text into numerical representations and are used to improve search relevance by understanding semantic meaning. These models are often implemented in **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (**RAG**) scenarios to enhance recommendation engines by linking similar content.

When you want to build an application that interacts with other software tools dynamically, you can add **function calling** and **JSON support**. These capabilities allow AI models to work efficiently with structured data, making them useful for automating API calls, database queries, and structured data processing.

##### Specialize with regional and domain-specific models

Certain models are designed for specific languages, regions, or industries. These models can outperform general-purpose generative AI in their respective domains. For example:

- Core42 JAIS is an Arabic language LLM, making it the best choice for applications targeting Arabic-speaking users.
- Mistral Large has a strong focus on European languages, ensuring better linguistic accuracy for multilingual applications.
- Nixtla TimeGEN-1 specializes in time-series forecasting, making it ideal for financial predictions, supply chain optimization, and demand forecasting.

If your project has regional, linguistic, or industry-specific needs, these models can provide more relevant results than general-purpose AI.

##### Balance flexibility and performance with open versus proprietary models

You also need to decide whether to use open-source models or proprietary models, each with its own advantages.

**Proprietary models** are best for cutting-edge performance and enterprise use. Azure offers models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Mistral Large, and Cohere Command R+, which deliver industry-leading AI capabilities. These models are ideal for businesses needing enterprise-level security, support, and high accuracy.

**Open-source models** are best for flexibility and cost-efficiency. There are hundreds of open-source models available in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog from Hugging Face, and models from Meta, Databricks, Snowflake, and Nvidia. Open models give developers more control, allowing fine-tuning, customization, and local deployment.

Whatever model you choose, you can use the Azure AI Foundry model catalog. Using models through the model catalog meets the key enterprise requirements for usage:

- **Data and privacy**: you get to decide what happens with your data.
- **Security and compliance**: built-in security.
- **Responsible AI and content safety**: evaluations and content safety.

Now you know the language models that are available to you, you should have an understanding of whether AI can indeed solve your use case. If you think a language model would enrich your application, you then need to select the specific model that you want to deploy and integrate.

#### How do I _select_ the best model for my use case?

To select the best language model for you use case, you need to decide on what criteria you're using to filter the models. The criteria are the necessary characteristics you identify for a model. Four characteristics you can consider are:

- **Task type**: What type of task do you need the model to perform? Does it include the understanding of only text, or also audio, or video, or multiple modalities?
- **Precision**: Is the base model good enough or do you need a fine-tuned model that is trained on a specific skill or dataset?
- **Openness**: Do you want to be able to fine-tune the model yourself?
- **Deployment**: Do you want to deploy the model locally, on a serverless endpoint, or do you want to manage the deployment infrastructure?

You already explored the various types of models available in the previous section. Now, let's explore in more detail how precision and performance can be important filters when choosing a model.

##### Filter models for precision

In generative AI, precision refers to the accuracy of the model in generating correct and relevant outputs. It measures the proportion of true positive results (correct outputs) among all generated outputs. High precision means fewer irrelevant or incorrect results, making the model more reliable.

When integrating a language model into an app, you can choose between a base model or a fine-tuned model. A base model, like GPT-4, is pretrained on a large dataset and can handle various tasks but can lack precision for specific domains. Techniques like prompt engineering can improve this, but sometimes fine-tuning is necessary.

A fine-tuned model is trained further on a smaller, task-specific dataset to improve its precision and ability to generate relevant outputs for specific applications. You can either use a fine-tuned model or fine-tune a model yourself.

##### Filter models for performance

You can evaluate your model performance at different phases, using various evaluation approaches.

When you're exploring models through the Azure AI Foundry model catalog, you can use **model benchmarks** to compare publicly available metrics like coherence and accuracy across models and datasets. These benchmarks can help you in the initial exploration phase, but give little information on how the model would perform in your specific use case.

|Benchmark|Description|
|---|---|
|**Accuracy**|Compares model-generated text with correct answer according to the dataset. Result is one if generated text matches the answer exactly, and zero otherwise.|
|**Coherence**|Measures whether the model output flows smoothly, reads naturally, and resembles human-like language.|
|**Fluency**|Assesses how well the generated text adheres to grammatical rules, syntactic structures, and appropriate usage of vocabulary, resulting in linguistically correct and natural-sounding responses.|
|**Groundedness**|Measures alignment between the model's generated answers and the input data.|
|**GPT Similarity**|Quantifies the semantic similarity between a ground truth sentence (or document) and the prediction sentence generated by an AI model.|
|**Quality index**|A comparative aggregate score between 0 and 1, with better-performing models scoring a higher value|
|**Cost**|The cost of using the model based on a price-per-token. Cost is a useful metric with which to compare quality, enabling you to determine an appropriate tradeoff for your needs.|

To evaluate how a selected model performs regarding your specific requirements, you can consider **manual** or **automated** evaluations. Manual evaluations allow you to rate your model's responses. Automated evaluations include traditional machine learning metrics and AI-assisted metrics that are calculated and generated for you.

When you evaluate a model’s performance, it's common to start with manual evaluations, as they quickly assess the quality of the model’s responses. For more systematic comparisons, automated evaluations using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score based on your own ground truth offer a faster, scalable, and more objective approach.

#### Can I _scale_ for real-world workloads?

You selected a model for your use case and have successfully built a prototype. Now, you need to understand how to scale for real-world workloads.

Considerations for scaling a generative AI solution include:

- **Model deployment**: Where will you deploy the model for the best balance of performance and cost?
- **Model monitoring and optimization**: How will you monitor, evaluate, and optimize model performance?
- **Prompt management**: How will you orchestrate and optimize prompts to maximize the accuracy and relevance of generated responses?
- **Model lifecycle**: How will you manage model, data, and code updates as part of an ongoing _Generative AI Operations_ (GenAIOps) lifecycle?

Azure AI Foundry provides visual and code-first tools that can help you build and maintain a scalable generative AI solution.

### Deploy a model to an endpoint

When you develop a generative AI app, you need to integrate language models into your application. To be able to use a language model, you need to deploy the model. Let's explore how to deploy language models in the Azure AI Foundry, after first understanding why to deploy a model.

#### Why deploy a model?

You train a model to generate output based on some input. To get value out of your model, you need a solution that allows you to send input to the model, which the model processes, after which the output is visualized for you.

With generative AI apps, the most common type of solution is a chat application that expects a user question, which the model processes, to generate an adequate response. The response is then visualized to the user as a response to their question.

![Diagram of user question being processed by model deployed to endpoint.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-models-azure-ai-studio/media/request-endpoint.png)

You can integrate a language model with a chat application by deploying the model to an **endpoint**. An endpoint is a specific URL where a deployed model or service can be accessed. Each model deployment typically has its own unique endpoint, which allows different applications to communicate with the model through an **API** (**Application Programming Interface**).

When a user asks a question:

1. An API request is sent to the endpoint.
2. The endpoint specifies the model that processes the request.
3. The result is sent back to the app through an API response.

When you deploy a language model from the model catalog with the Azure AI Foundry, you get an endpoint, which consists of a **target URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) and a unique **key**. For example, a target URI for a deployed GPT-3.5 model can be:

```
https://ai-aihubdevdemo.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-35-turbo/chat/completions?api-version=2023-03-15-preview
```

The URI includes:

- Your **AI hub name**, for example `ai-aihubdevdemo`.
- Your deployed **model name**, for example `gpt-35-turbo`.
- The **task** for the model, for example `chat/completion`.

To protect your deployed models, each deployment comes with a key. You're only authorized to send and receive requests to and from the target URI, if you also provide the key to authenticate.

Now that you understand why you want to deploy a model, let's explore the deployment options with Azure AI Foundry.

#### Deploy a language model with Azure AI Foundry

When you deploy a language model with Azure AI Foundry, you have several types available, which depend on the model you want to deploy.

You can deploy:

- [Azure OpenAI models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with Azure OpenAI service and Azure AI model inference.
- Third-party models like DeepSeek-R1 as [Models as a Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/models) as part of Azure AI model inference or with [serverless APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview#content-safety-for-models-deployed-via-serverless-apis?azure-portal=true).
- Open and custom models like models from Hugging Face with your own [user-managed compute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview#availability-of-models-for-deployment-as-managed-compute?azure-portal=true).

The associated cost depends on the type of model you deploy, which deployment option you choose, and what you are doing with the model:

||Azure OpenAI Service|Azure AI Foundry Models|Serverless compute|Managed compute|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Supported models|Azure OpenAI models|_Flagship_ models (including Azure OpenAI models and Models-as-a-service models)|Models-as-a-service models|Open and custom models|
|Hosting service|Azure OpenAI resource|Azure AI Services resource|AI Project resource|AI Project resource|
|Deployment cost|-|-|Minimal endpoint cost|Charged per minute|
|Inferencing cost|Token-based billing|Token-based billing|Token-based billing|-|

### Optimize model performance

After you deploy your model to an endpoint, you can start interacting with it to see how it works. Let's explore how you can use prompt engineering techniques to optimize your model's performance.

#### Apply prompt patterns to optimize your model's output

The quality of the questions you send to the language model, directly influences the quality of the responses you get back. You can carefully construct your question, or **prompt**, to receive better and more interesting responses. The process of designing and optimizing prompts to improve the model's performance is also known as **prompt engineering**.

Prompt engineering requires users to ask relevant, specific, unambiguous, and well-structured questions, instructing the model to generate more accurate responses. To understand how to create well-defined prompts, let's explore some patterns that help you improve the output of a model:

- Instruct the model to act as a persona.
- Guide the model to suggest better questions.
- Provide a template to generate output in a specific format.
- Understand how a model reasons by asking it to reflect.
- Add context to improve the accuracy of the model's output.

>**Note**: The patterns listed here are based on the work by [White et al., (2023) who constructed a prompt pattern catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382).

As a developer, an effective approach is to add instructions to your deployed model in the form of a _system prompt_. The system prompt sets the model's behavior and allows you to guide the model without exposing the end user to the instructions. The best results are often achieved through the assignment of an explicit system prompt and guidance (or templates) that help users submit prompts that reflect the patterns described here.

##### Instruct the model to act as a persona

When you want the model to take a specific point of view or perspective when answering a question, you can ask it to act as a persona.

For example, you can ask the model to respond as if it's a seasoned marketing professional if you're working in sales and need insights about a new CRM software.

||No persona specified|With persona specified|
|---|---|---|
|System prompt|_None_|You're a seasoned marketing professional that writes advertising copy for an audience of technical customers.|
|User prompt|Write a one-sentence description of a CRM product.|Write a one-sentence description of a CRM product.|
|Model response|A CRM product is a software tool designed to manage a company's interactions with current and potential customers, encompassing sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.|Experience seamless customer relationship management with our CRM product, designed to streamline your business operations, enhance customer interactions, and drive sales growth with its intuitive interface and robust analytics tools.|

You can create different personas for various business roles. Think of roles like a product manager, data analyst, customer service expert, or teacher. Define the persona and add more detail to what you expect that persona to know or do to get tailored, context-driven responses.

##### Ask for better question suggestions

When you want the model to help refine your question, you can ask it to suggest better ways to phrase your query. You can also ask it to provide extra context.

For example, if you're seeking advice on cooking a meal, you can prompt the model to suggest clarifying questions to help you get a more targeted answer.

||No suggestions given|With suggestions given|
|---|---|---|
|System prompt|You're an AI chef who can advise on menus.|You're an AI chef who can advise on menus. You're approachable and always want to provide the best advice you can.|
|User prompt|I have to host a dinner party for four people. What should I cook?|I have to host a dinner party for four people. What should I cook? What other information do you need to help me plan a great meal for my guests?|
|Model response|Hosting a dinner party for four is a wonderful opportunity to showcase your culinary skills. Here's a suggested three-course menu that balances flavors and provides a pleasant dining experience:  <br>  <br>_Appetizer_  <br>**Caprese Salad Skewers**  <br>- _Ingredients_: Cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella balls, fresh basil leaves, balsamic glaze, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  <br>- _Instructions_: Thread a cherry tomato, a basil leaf, and a mozzarella ball onto small skewers.

When you encourage the model to suggest clarifications or extra details can help you ask the right questions and achieve better, more accurate answers in fewer interactions.

##### Specify the desired format for responses

When you want the model to generate output in a specific format, you can provide a template or structure in your prompt.

For example, if you're a sports reporting composing a historical article, you can request that the model follow a specific template, which includes headings, bullet points, and data breakdowns.

||No template specified|With template specified|
|---|---|---|
|System prompt|You're a helpful AI assistant.|You're a helpful AI assistant for sports reporters.|
|User prompt|What happened in the 2018 Soccer World Cup final?|What happened in the 2018 Soccer World Cup final? Format the result to show the match date, location, and the two teams competing. Then the final score, and finally any notable events that occurred during the match.|
|Model response|The 2018 FIFA World Cup final took place on July 15, 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. France faced Croatia in the match. France emerged victorious with a 4-2 win. The goals for France were scored by Mario Mandzukic (own goal), Antoine Griezmann (penalty), Paul Pogba, and Kylian Mbappé. Croatia's goals were scored by Ivan Perišić and Mandzukic. Kylian Mbappé, at just 19 years old, became the second youngest player to score in a World Cup final, after Pelé. This victory marked France's second World Cup title, their first being in 1998.|**Match Date**: July 15, 2018  <br>**Location**: Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow, Russia  <br>**Teams Competing**: France vs. Croatia  <br>**Final Score**: France 4, Croatia 2  <br>  <br>**Notable Events**:  <br><br>1. **First Half**: France took an early lead in the 18th minute with an own goal by Mario Mandžukić after a cross from Antoine Griezmann. Croatia equalized in the 28th minute with a header from Ivan Perišić, who had just come on as a substitute. Just before halftime, in the 44th minute, Paul Pogba scored from a free kick to put France back in the lead.<br>2. **Second Half**: The game saw a dramatic increase in intensity after the break. In the 68th minute, Kylian Mbappé scored his first World Cup goal, bringing the score to 3-1 in favor of France. Croatia managed to score again in the 69th minute when Mandžukić headed in a cross from Perišić, reducing the deficit to 3-2.<br>3. **Final Moments**: In the 81st minute, a controversial penalty was awarded to France after a handball by Croatian defender Dejan Lovren. Griezmann converted the penalty, sealing the victory for France with a 4-2 scoreline.<br>4. **Additional Context**: This match was notable for being the youngest ever World Cup final in terms of average age, featuring players like Mbappé and N’Golo Kanté. France’s victory marked their second World Cup title, having previously won in 1998. Croatia reached the final for the first time in their history, finishing as runners-up.|

You can apply this approach to other scenarios where a specific format is needed, such as generating emails, summaries, proposals, or even code and scripts. Define the format template clearly and provide details on how you want the output structured to get consistent and organized responses.

You can also use a **one-shot** or **few-shots** approach by providing one or more examples to help the model identify a desired pattern.

##### Ask for an explanation of reasoning

When you want the model to explain the reasoning behind its answers, you can ask the model to automatically reflect on its rationale and assumptions after providing a response.

For example, if you're working on a mathematical problem, you can ask the model to explain the reasoning behind specific calculations.

||No reflection specified|With reflection specified|
|---|---|---|
|System prompt|You're an AI math assistant.|You're an AI math assistant. You always explain your answers.|
|User prompt|A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse side of length 3 cm and an adjacent side length of 2cm.What is the length of the remaining side?|A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse side of length 3 cm and an adjacent side length of 2cm.What is the length of the remaining side?|
|Model response|Approximately 2.24 cm.|We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, this can be written as:  <br>_c² = a² + b²_  <br>where _c_ is the length of the hypotenuse, and _a_ and _b_ are the lengths of the other two sides.  <br>In this problem, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 3 cm) and the length of one of the other sides (a = 2 cm). We need to find the length of the remaining side (b).  <br>Plugging the given values into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:  <br>_3² = 2² + b²_  <br>_9 = 4 + b²_  <br>Now, we can solve for b²:  <br>_b² = 9 - 4_  <br>_b² = 5_  <br>Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the remaining side:  <br>_b = √5 ≈ 2.24 cm_  <br>So, the length of the remaining side is approximately 2.24 cm.|

You can apply this approach when you want explanations in data analysis, marketing strategy, or technical troubleshooting. When you ask the model to define its reasoning, you use a technique called **chain-of-thought** to make it think step by step.

##### Add context

When you want the model to focus on specific topics, you can specify the context to consider. You can also tell the model to ignore irrelevant information.

For example, if you're planning a trip, you can provide the model with more context to help improve the relevance of its response.

||No context specified|With context specified|
|---|---|---|
|System prompt|You're an AI travel assistant.|You're an AI travel assistant.|
|User question|When should I visit Edinburgh?|When should I visit Edinburgh? I'm particularly interested in attending Scotland's home matches in the Six Nations rugby tournament.|
|Model response|Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is a wonderful destination with a rich history and vibrant culture. The best time to visit Edinburgh largely depends on your preferences for weather, events, and tourist crowds.  <br><br>1. Spring (April to June): The weather starts to warm up, and the days get longer. Springtime is perfect for exploring the city's historic sites, gardens, and parks, such as the Royal Botanic Garden. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world's largest arts festival, takes place in August, which is the end of summer.<br>2. Summer (July to August): The weather is at its warmest, and the days are long. This is a popular time to visit, but it can also be crowded with tourists. Summer is ideal for outdoor activities, and you can enjoy the Edinburgh International Festival and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.<br>3. Autumn (September to November): The weather begins to cool down, and the leaves change color, creating a picturesque backdrop for the city's historic architecture. It's less crowded, and you can enjoy events like the Edinburgh International Book Festival.<br>4. Winter (December to February): The weather is colder, and there may be snowfall, which can create a magical atmosphere. Winter is a quieter time to visit, with fewer tourists and lower prices. You can attend events like the Edinburgh Christmas Market and the Hogmanay Street Party, which celebrates the New Year.<br><br>  <br>In summary, the best time to visit Edinburgh depends on your preferences. Spring and autumn offer pleasant weather and fewer crowds, while summer is ideal for outdoor activities and festivals. Winter can be a quieter, more magical experience, with festive events to enjoy.|The Six Nations rugby tournament typically runs from late January to early March. Edinburgh, as a host city, often has matches at Murrayfield Stadium, which is Scotland's national stadium. To ensure you don't miss Scotland's home matches in the Six Nations, I recommend planning your visit for this period.  <br>  <br>However, keep in mind that match dates and times can vary, so it's a good idea to check the official Six Nations website or the Scottish Rugby Union's website for the exact schedule of matches. Additionally, Edinburgh has a lot to offer beyond rugby, with its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultural scene, so you might consider extending your stay to explore the city before or after the tournament.  <br>  <br>Also, remember that visiting during the tournament might mean larger crowds and busier accommodations, so book your flights, hotel, and transportation well in advance to ensure a smooth experience. Enjoy your trip to Edinburgh and the thrilling atmosphere of the Six Nations rugby matches!|

By defining what the model should focus on or disregard, you can ensure the conversation stays on track and generate more relevant, tailored responses.

You can specify the context by describing what it should or shouldn't include, and by connecting the model to data sources it should retrieve context from before generating an answer.

#### Apply model optimization strategies

>**Note**: This section discusses options and considerations for model optimization that you may consider beyond prompt engineering. A full exploration of _how_ to apply these optimization strategies is beyond the scope of this module.

Prompt engineering can be an effective way to optimize model responses, but in some cases it may not provide sufficient context or guidance to always meet your exact needs. As a developer, you can consider the following additional optimization strategies to improve the relevance of your generative AI application's responses:

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A technique that involves using a data source to provide _grounding_ context to prompts. RAG can be a useful approach when you need the model to answer questions based on a specific knowledge domain or when you need the model to consider information related to events that occurred after the training data on which the model is based.
- **Fine-tuning**: A technique that involves extending the training of a foundation model by providing example prompts and responses that reflect the desired output format and style.

Both of these approaches involve additional cost, complexity, and maintainability challenges, so as a general rule it's best to start your optimization efforts through prompt engineering, and then consider additional strategies if necessary.

The strategy you should choose as a developer depends on your requirements:

![Diagram showing the various strategies to optimize the model's performance.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-models-azure-ai-studio/media/model-optimization.png)

- **Optimize for context**: When the model lacks contextual knowledge and you want to **maximize responses accuracy**.
- **Optimize the model**: When you want to improve the response format, style, or speech by **maximizing consistency of behavior**.

To optimize for context, you can apply a **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (**RAG**) pattern. With RAG, you _ground_ your data by first retrieving context from a data source before generating a response. For example, you want employees to ask questions about expense claim processes and limits based on your own corporation's expenses policy documentation.

When you want the model to respond in a specific style or format, you can instruct the model to do so by adding guidelines in the system message. When you notice the model's behavior isn't consistent, you can further enforce consistency in behavior by **fine-tuning** a model. With fine-tuning, you train a base language model on a dataset of example prompts and responses before integrating it in your application, with the result that the fine-tuned model will produce responses that are consistent with the examples in the fine-tuning training dataset.

You can use any combination of optimization strategies, for example prompt engineering, RAG _and_ a fine-tuned model, to improve your language application.

### Choose and deploy a language model

The Azure AI Foundry model catalog serves as a central repository where you can explore and use a variety of models, facilitating the creation of your generative AI scenario.

In this exercise, you’ll explore the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal, and compare potential models for a generative AI application that assists in solving problems.

This exercise will take approximately **25** minutes.

#### Chat with the _gpt-4o_ model

Now that you have a model deployment, you can use the playground to test it.

1. In the chat playground, in the **Setup** pane, ensure that your **gpt-4o** model is selected and in the **Give the model instructions and context** field, set the system prompt to `You are an AI assistant that helps solve problems.`
2. Select **Apply changes** to update the system prompt.
    
3. In the chat window, enter the following query
    
    ```
    I have a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain that I need to take over a river in a boat. I can only take one thing at a time. If I leave the chicken and the grain unattended, the chicken will eat the grain. If I leave the fox and the chicken unattended, the fox will eat the chicken. How can I get all three things across the river without anything being eaten?
    ```
    
4. View the response. Then, enter the following follow-up query:
    
    ```
    Explain your reasoning.
    ```
    

#### Deploy another model

When you created your project, the **gpt-4o** model you selected was automatically deployed. Let’s deploy the ***Phi-4-mini-instruct** model you also considered.

1. In the navigation bar on the left, in the **My assets** section, select **Models + endpoints**.
2. In the **Model deployments** tab, in the **+ Deploy model** drop-down list, select **Deploy base model**. Then search for `Phi-4-mini-instruct` and confirm you selection.
3. Agree to the model license.
4. Deploy a **Phi-4-mini-instruct** model with the following settings:
    - **Deployment name**: _A valid name for your model deployment_
    - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
    - **Deployment details**: _Use the default settings_
5. Wait for the deployment to complete.

#### Chat with the _Phi-4_ model

Now let’s chat with the new model in the playground.

1. In the navigation bar, select **Playgrounds**. Then select the **Chat playground**.
2. In the chat playground, in the **Setup** pane, ensure that your **Phi-4-mini-instruct** model is selected and in the chat box, provide the first line as `System message: You are an AI assistant that helps solve problems.` (the same system prompt you used to test the gpt-4o model, but since there is no system message setup, we’re providing it in the first chat for context.)
3. On a new line in the chat window (below your system message), enter the following query
    
    
    ```
    I have a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain that I need to take over a river in a boat. I can only take one thing at a time. If I leave the chicken and the grain unattended, the chicken will eat the grain. If I leave the fox and the chicken unattended, the fox will eat the chicken. How can I get all three things across the river without anything being eaten?
    ```
    
4. View the response. Then, enter the following follow-up query:
    
    ```
    Explain your reasoning.
    ```
    

#### Perform a further comparison

1. Use the drop-down list in the **Setup** pane to switch between your models, testing both models with the following puzzle (the correct answer is 40!):
    
    ```
    I have 53 socks in my drawer: 21 identical blue, 15 identical black and 17 identical red. The lights are out, and it is completely dark. How many socks must I take out to make 100 percent certain I have at least one pair of black socks?
    ```
    

#### Reflect on the models

You’ve compared two models, which may vary in terms of both their ability to generate appropriate responses and in their cost. In any generative scenario, you need to find a model with the right balance of suitability for the task you need it to perform and the cost of using the model for the number of requests you expect it to have to handle.

The details and benchmarks provided in the model catalog, along with the ability to visually compare models provides a useful starting point when identifying candidate models for a generative AI solution. You can then test candidate models with a variety of system and user prompts in the chat playground.

#### Clean up

If you’ve finished exploring Azure AI Foundry portal, you should delete the resources you have created in this exercise to avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the resources used in this exercise.
2. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
3. Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.


## Develop an AI app with the Azure AI Foundry SDK
### Introduction

Developers creating AI solutions with Azure AI Foundry need to work with a combination of services and software frameworks. The Azure AI Foundry SDK is designed to bring together common services and code libraries in an AI project through a central programmatic access point, making it easier for developers to write the code needed to build effective AI apps on Azure.

>**Note**: Azure AI Foundry SDK is currently in public preview. Details described in this module are subject to change.

### What is the Azure AI Foundry SDK?

The Azure AI Foundry SDK is a set of packages and services designed to work together to enable developers to write code that uses resources in an Azure AI Foundry project. With the Azure AI Foundry SDK, developers can create applications that connect to a project, access the resource connections and models in that project, and use them to perform AI operations, such as sending prompts to a generative AI model and processing the responses

The SDK provides Python and Microsoft C# .NET libraries that you can use to build AI applications based on Azure AI Foundry projects.

>**Note**: In the preview release of the SDK, some capabilities may not be available for both languages.

#### Installing SDK packages

The core package for working with projects in the Azure AI Foundry SDK is the **Azure AI Projects** library, which enables you to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project and access the resources defined within it.

To use the Azure AI Projects library in Python, you can use the **pip** package installation utility to install the **azure-ai-projects** package from PyPi:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-projects
```

#### Using the SDK to connect to a project

The first task in most Azure AI Foundry SDK code is to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project. Each project has a unique _endpoint_, which you can find on the project's **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

[![Screenshot of the project overview page in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-overview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-overview.png#lightbox)

>**Note**: The project provides multiple endpoints and keys, including:

- An endpoint for the project itself; which can be used to access project connections, agents, and models in the Azure AI Foundry resource.
- An endpoint for Azure OpenAI Service APIs in the project's Azure AI Foundry resource.
- An endpoint for Azure AI services APIs (such as Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Language) in the Azure AI Foundry resource.

You can use the project endpoint in your code to create an **AIProjectClient** object, which provides a programmatic proxy for the project.

The following code snippet shows how to create am **AIProjectClient** object in Python.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
...

project_endpoint = "https://......"
project_client = AIProjectClient(            
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    endpoint=project_endpoint)


```

>**Note**: The code uses the default Azure credentials to authenticate when accessing the project. To enable this authentication, in addition to the **azure-ai-projects** package, you need to install the **azure-identity** package:

`pip install azure-identity`

>**Tip**: To access the project successfully, the code must be run in the context of an authenticated Azure session. For example, you could use the Azure command-line interface (CLI) `az-login` command to sign in before running the code.

### Work with project connections

Each Azure AI Foundry project includes **connected resources**, which are defined both at the _parent_ (Azure AI Foundry resource or hub) level, and at the _project_ level. Each resource is a _connection_ to an external service, such as Azure storage, Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, or another Azure AI Foundry resource.

[![Screenshot of the connected resources page in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-connections.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-connections.png#lightbox)

With the Azure AI Foundry SDK, you can connect to a project and retrieve connections; which you can then use to consume the connected services.

The **AIProjectClient** object in Python has a **connections** property, which you can use to access the resource connections in the project. Methods of the **connections** object include:

- `connections.list()`: Returns a collection of connection objects, each representing a connection in the project. You can filter the results by specifying an optional **connection_type** parameter with a valid enumeration, such as `ConnectionType.AZURE_OPEN_AI`.
- `connections.get(connection_name, include_credentials)`: Returns a connection object for the connection with the name specified. If the **include_credentials** parameter is **True** (the default value), the credentials required to connect to the connection are returned - for example, in the form of an API key for an Azure AI services resource.

The connection objects returned by these methods include connection-specific properties, including credentials, which you can use to connect to the associated resource.

The following code example lists all of the resource connections that have been added to a project:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

try:

    # Get project client
    project_endpoint = "https://....."
    project_client = AIProjectClient(            
            credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
            endpoint=project_endpoint,
        )

    ## List all connections in the project
    connections = project_client.connections
    print("List all connections:")
    for connection in connections.list():
        print(f"{connection.name} ({connection.type})")

except Exception as ex:
    print(ex)
```
### Create a chat client
A common scenario in an AI application is to connect to a generative AI model and use _prompts_ to engage in a chat-based dialog with it.

While you can use the Azure OpenAI SDK, to connect "directly" to a model using key-based or Microsoft Entra ID authentication; when your model is deployed in an Azure AI Foundry project, you can also use the Azure AI Foundry SDK to retrieve a project client, from which you can then get an authenticated OpenAI chat client for any models deployed in the project's Azure AI Foundry resource. This approach makes it easy to write code that consumes models deployed in your project, switching between them easily by changing the model deployment name parameter.

>**Tip**: You can use the OpenAI chat client provided by an Azure AI Foundry project to chat with any model deployed in the associated Azure AI Foundry resource - even non-OpenAI models, such as Microsoft Phi models.

The following Python code sample uses the **get_azure_openai_client()** method in the Azure AI project's **inference** operations object to get an OpenAI client with which to chat with a model that has been deployed in the project'a Azure AI Foundry resource.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from openai import AzureOpenAI

try:

    # connect to the project
    project_endpoint = "https://......"
    project_client = AIProjectClient(            
            credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
            endpoint=project_endpoint,
        )

    # Get a chat client
    chat_client = project_client.inference.get_azure_openai_client(api_version="2024-10-21")

    # Get a chat completion based on a user-provided prompt
    user_prompt = input("Enter a question:")

    response = chat_client.complete(
        model=model_deployment_name,
        [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
        ]
        ],
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

except Exception as ex:
    print(ex)
```

>**Note**: In addition to the **azure-ai-projects** and **azure-identity** packages discussed previously, the sample code shown here assumes that the **openai** package has been installed: `pip install openai`

### Create a generative AI chat app

In this exercise, you use the Azure AI Foundry SDK to create a simple chat app that connects to a project and chats with a language model.

This exercise takes approximately **40** minutes.

> **Note**: This exercise is based on pre-release SDKs, which may be subject to change. Where necessary, we’ve used specific versions of packages; which may not reflect the latest available versions. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

#### Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

Let’s start by deploying a model in an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it’s open):
    
    [![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)
    
2. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the `gpt-4o` model; which we’ll use in our project.
3. In the search results, select the **gpt-4o** model to see its details, and then at the top of the page for the model, select **Use this model**.
4. When prompted to create a project, enter a valid name for your project and expand **Advanced options**.
5. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your project:
    
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: _A valid name for your Azure AI Foundry resource_
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_
    - **Region**: _Select any **AI Services supported location**_*
    
    > * Some Azure AI resources are constrained by regional model quotas. In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, there’s a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.
    
6. Select **Create** and wait for your project, including the gpt-4 model deployment you selected, to be created.
7. When your project is created, the chat playground will be opened automatically.
8. In the **Setup** pane, note the name of your model deployment; which should be **gpt-4o**. You can confirm this by viewing the deployment in the **Models and endpoints** page (just open that page in the navigation pane on the left).
9. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Overview** to see the main page for your project; which looks like this:
    
    [![Screenshot of a Azure AI Foundry project overview page.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-project.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-project.png)
    

#### Create a client application to chat with the model

Now that you have deployed a model, you can use the Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI SDKs to develop an application that chats with it.

> **Tip**: You can choose to develop your solution using Python or Microsoft C#. Follow the instructions in the appropriate section for your chosen language.

##### Prepare the application configuration

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, view the **Overview** page for your project.
2. In the **Endpoints and keys** area, ensure that the **Azure AI Foundry** library is selected and view the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**. You’ll use this endpoint to connect to your project and model in a client application.
    
    > **Note**: You can also use the Azure OpenAI endpoint!
    
3. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab). Then in the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.
    
    Close any welcome notifications to see the Azure portal home page.
    
4. Use the **[>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a **_PowerShell_** environment with no storage in your subscription.
    
    The cloud shell provides a command-line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal. You can resize or maximize this pane to make it easier to work in.
    
    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a _Bash_ environment, switch it to **_PowerShell_**.
    
5. In the cloud shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version** (this is required to use the code editor).
    
    **Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell before continuing.**
    
6. In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise (type the command, or copy it to the clipboard and then right-click in the command line and paste as plain text):
    
    ```bash
    rm -r mslearn-ai-foundry -f
    git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-ai-studio mslearn-ai-foundry
    ```
    
    > **Tip**: As you enter commands into the cloudshell, the output may take up a large amount of the screen buffer. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.
    
7. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the chat application code files and view them:
    
    
    **Python**

    
    ```bash
    cd mslearn-ai-foundry/labfiles/chat-app/python
    ls -a -l
    ```
    
    
    The folder contains a code file as well as a configuration file for application settings and a file defining the project runtime and package requrirements.
    
8. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you’ll use:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv labenv
    ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt azure-identity azure-ai-projects openai
    ```
    
    
9. Enter the following command to edit the configuration file that has been provided:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    code .env
    ```
    
    
    The file is opened in a code editor.
    
10. In the code file, replace the **your_project_endpoint** placeholder with the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint** for your project (copied from the **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal); and the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name of your gpt-4 model deployment.
11. After you’ve replaced the placeholders, within the code editor, use the **CTRL+S** command or **Right-click > Save** to save your changes and then use the **CTRL+Q** command or **Right-click > Quit** to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

##### Write code to connect to your project and chat with your model

> **Tip**: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation.

1. Enter the following command to edit the code file that has been provided:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    code chat-app.py
    ```
    
    
2. In the code file, note the existing statements that have been added at the top of the file to import the necessary SDK namespaces. Then, find the comment **Add references**, and add the following code to reference the namespaces in the libraries you installed previously:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    # Add references
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    ```
    
    
3. In the **main** function, under the comment **Get configuration settings**, note that the code loads the project connection string and model deployment name values you defined in the configuration file.
4. Find the comment **Initialize the project client**, and add the following code to connect to your Azure AI Foundry project:
    
    > **Tip**: Be careful to maintain the correct indentation level for your code.
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    # Initialize the project client
    project_client = AIProjectClient(            
             credential=DefaultAzureCredential(
                 exclude_environment_credential=True,
                 exclude_managed_identity_credential=True
             ),
             endpoint=project_endpoint,
         )
    ```
    
    
5. Find the comment **Get a chat client**, and add the following code to create a client object for chatting with a model:
    
    **Python**
    
    
    ```python
    # Get a chat client
    openai_client = project_client.inference.get_azure_openai_client(api_version="2024-10-21")
    ```
    
    
6. Find the comment **Initialize prompt with system message**, and add the following code to initialize a collection of messages with a system prompt.
    
    **Python**
    
    
    ```python
    # Initialize prompt with system message
    prompt = [
             {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant that answers questions."}
         ]
    ```
    
    
7. Note that the code includes a loop to allow a user to input a prompt until they enter “quit”. Then in the loop section, find the comment **Get a chat completion** and add the following code to add the user input to the prompt, retrieve the completion from your model, and add the completion to the prompt (so that you retain chat history for future iterations):
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    # Get a chat completion
    prompt.append({"role": "user", "content": input_text})
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
             model=model_deployment,
             messages=prompt)
    completion = response.choices[0].message.content
    print(completion)
    prompt.append({"role": "assistant", "content": completion})
    ```
    
    
8. Use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes to the code file.

##### Sign into Azure and run the app

1. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to sign into Azure.

    
    ```bash
    az login
    ```
    
    **You must sign into Azure - even though the cloud shell session is already authenticated.**
    
    > **Note**: In most scenarios, just using _az login_ will be sufficient. However, if you have subscriptions in multiple tenants, you may need to specify the tenant by using the _–tenant_ parameter. See [Sign into Azure interactively using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively) for details.
    
2. When prompted, follow the instructions to open the sign-in page in a new tab and enter the authentication code provided and your Azure credentials. Then complete the sign in process in the command line, selecting the subscription containing your Azure AI Foundry hub if prompted.
3. After you have signed in, enter the following command to run the application:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    python chat-app.py
    ```
    
    
4. When prompted, enter a question, such as `What is the fastest animal on Earth?` and review the response from your generative AI model.
5. Try some follow-up questions, like `Where can I see one?` or `Are they endangered?`. The conversation should continue, using the chat history as context for each iteration.
6. When you’re finished, enter `quit` to exit the program.

> **Tip**: If the app fails because the rate limit is exceeded. Wait a few seconds and try again. If there is insufficient quota available in your subscription, the model may not be able to respond.

#### Summary

In this exercise, you used the Azure AI Foundry SDK to create a client application for a generative AI model that you deployed in an Azure AI Foundry project.

#### Clean up

If you’ve finished exploring Azure AI Foundry portal, you should delete the resources you have created in this exercise to avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the resources used in this exercise.
2. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
3. Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.


## Get started with prompt flow to develop language model apps in the Azure AI Foundry

### Introduction

The true power of **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) lies in their application. Whether you want to use LLMs to classify web pages into categories, or to build a chatbot on your data. To harness the power of the LLMs available, you need to create an application that combines your data sources with LLMs and generates the desired output.

To develop, test, tune, and deploy LLM applications, you can use **prompt flow**, accessible in the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow) and the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow).

>**Note**: The focus of this module is on understanding and exploring prompt flow through Azure AI Foundry. However, note that the content applies to the prompt flow experience in both Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI Foundry.

Prompt flow takes a **prompt** as input, which in the context of LLMs, refers to the query provided to the LLM application to generate a response. It's the text or set of instructions given to the LLM application, prompting it to generate output or perform a specific task.

For example, when you want to use a text generation model, the prompt might be a sentence or a paragraph that initiates the generation process. In the context of a question-answering model, the prompt could be a query asking for information on a particular topic. The effectiveness of the prompt often depends on how well it conveys the user's intent and the desired outcome.

Prompt flow allows you to create **flows**, which refers to the sequence of actions or steps that are taken to achieve a specific task or functionality. A flow represents the overall process or pipeline that incorporates the interaction with the LLM to address a particular use case. The flow encapsulates the entire journey from receiving input to generating output or performing a desired action.

### Understand the development lifecycle of a large language model (LLM) app

Before understanding how to work with prompt flow, let's explore the development lifecycle of a Large Language Model (LLM) application.

The lifecycle consists of the following stages:

![Diagram of the four stages of the development lifecycle.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/development-lifecycle.png)

1. **Initialization**: Define the use case and design the solution.
2. **Experimentation**: Develop a flow and test with a small dataset.
3. **Evaluation and refinement**: Assess the flow with a larger dataset.
4. **Production**: Deploy and monitor the flow and application.

During both evaluation and refinement, and production, you might find that your solution needs to be improved. You can revert back to experimentation during which you develop your flow continuously, until you're satisfied with the results.

Let's explore each of these phases in more detail.

#### Initialization

Imagine you want to design and develop an LLM application to classify news articles. Before you start creating anything, you need to define what categories you want as output. You need to understand what a typical news article looks like, how you present the article as input to your application, and how the application generates the desired output.

In other words, during _initialization_ you:

![Diagram of the four steps during initialization.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/initialization.png)

1. Define the **objective**
2. Collect a **sample dataset**
3. Build a **basic prompt**
4. Design the **flow**

To design, develop, and test an LLM application, you need a sample dataset that serves as the input. A sample dataset is a small representative subset of the data you eventually expect to parse as input to your LLM application.

When collecting or creating the sample dataset, you should ensure diversity in the data to cover various scenarios and edge cases. You should also remove any privacy sensitive information from the dataset to avoid any vulnerabilities.

#### Experimentation

You collected a sample dataset of news articles, and decided on which categories you want the articles to be classified into. You designed a flow that takes a news article as input, and uses an LLM to classify the article. To test whether your flow generates the expected output, you run it against your sample dataset.

![Diagram of the four steps during experimentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/experimentation.png)

The _experimentation_ phase is an iterative process during which you (1) **run** the flow against a sample dataset. You then (2) **evaluate** the prompt's performance. If you're (3) satisfied with the result, you can **move on** to evaluation and refinement. If you think there's room for improvement, you can (4) **modify** the flow by changing the prompt or flow itself.

#### Evaluation and refinement

When you're satisfied with the output of the flow that classifies news articles, based on the sample dataset, you can assess the flow's performance against a larger dataset.

By testing the flow on a larger dataset, you can evaluate how well the LLM application generalizes to new data. During evaluation, you can identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization or refinement.

When you edit your flow, you should first run it against a smaller dataset before running it again against a larger dataset. Testing your flow with a smaller dataset allows you to more quickly respond to any issues.

Once your LLM application appears to be robust and reliable in handling various scenarios, you can decide to move the LLM application to production.

#### Production

Finally, your news article classification application is ready for _production_.

![Diagram of the three steps during production.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/production.png)

During production, you:

1. **Optimize** the flow that classifies incoming articles for efficiency and effectiveness.
2. **Deploy** your flow to an endpoint. When you call the endpoint, the flow is triggered to run and the desired output is generated.
3. **Monitor** the performance of your solution by collecting usage data and end-user feedback. By understanding how the application performs, you can improve the flow whenever necessary.

#### Explore the complete development lifecycle

Now that you understand each stage of the development lifecycle of an LLM application, you can explore the complete overview:

![Diagram of all stages including their steps of the development lifecycle.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/detailed-lifecycle.png)
### Understand core components and explore flow types

To create a Large Language Model (LLM) application with prompt flow, you need to understand prompt flow's core components.

#### Understand a flow

Prompt flow is a feature within Azure AI Foundry that allows you to author **flows**. Flows are executable workflows often consist of three parts:

1. **Inputs**: Represent data passed into the flow. Can be different data types like strings, integers, or boolean.
2. **Nodes**: Represent _tools_ that perform data processing, task execution, or algorithmic operations.
3. **Outputs**: Represent the data produced by the flow.

![Diagram of the three components of a flow pipeline.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/flow-pipeline.png)

Similar to a pipeline, a flow can consist of multiple nodes that can use the flow's inputs or any output generated by another node. You can add a node to a flow by choosing one of the available types of **tools**.

#### Explore the tools available in prompt flow

Three common tools are:

- **LLM tool**: Enables custom prompt creation utilizing Large Language Models.
- **Python tool**: Allows the execution of custom Python scripts.
- **Prompt tool**: Prepares prompts as strings for complex scenarios or integration with other tools.

Each tool is an executable unit with a specific function. You can use a tool to perform tasks like summarizing text, or making an API call. You can use multiple tools within one flow and use a tool multiple times.

>**Tip**: If you're looking for functionality that is not offered by the available tools, you can [create your own custom tool](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-tool/create-and-use-tool-package.html).

Whenever you add a new node to your flow, adding a new tool, you can define the expected inputs and outputs. A node can use one of the whole flow's inputs, or another node's output, effectively linking nodes together.

By defining the inputs, connecting nodes, and defining the desired outputs, you can create a flow. Flows help you create LLM applications for various purposes.

#### Understand the types of flows

There are three different types of flows you can create with prompt flow:

- **Standard flow**: Ideal for general LLM-based application development, offering a range of versatile tools.
- **Chat flow**: Designed for conversational applications, with enhanced support for chat-related functionalities.
- **Evaluation flow**: Focused on performance evaluation, allowing the analysis and improvement of models or applications through feedback on previous runs.

Now that you understand how a flow is structured and what you can use it for, let's explore how you can create a flow.

### Explore connections and runtimes


When you create a Large Language Model (LLM) application with prompt flow, you first need to configure any necessary **connections** and **runtimes**.

#### Explore connections

Whenever you want your flow to connect to external data source, service, or API, you need your flow to be authorized to communicate with that external service. When you create a **connection**, you configure a secure link between prompt flow and external services, ensuring seamless and safe data communication.

![Diagram showing a flow with two nodes, connecting to Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/connections.png)

Depending on the type of connection you create, the connection securely stores the endpoint, API key, or credentials necessary for prompt flow to communicate with the external service. Any necessary secrets aren't exposed to users, but instead are stored in an Azure Key Vault.

By setting up connections, users can easily reuse external services necessary for tools in their flows.

Certain built-in tools require you to have a connection configured:

|Connection type|Built-in tools|
|---|---|
|Azure OpenAI|LLM or Python|
|OpenAI|LLM or Python|
|Azure AI Search|Vector DB Lookup or Python|
|Serp|Serp API or Python|
|Custom|Python|

Prompt flow connections play pivotal roles in two scenarios. They automate API credential management, simplifying and securing the handling of sensitive access information. Additionally, they enable secure data transfer from various sources, crucial for maintaining data integrity and privacy across different environments.

#### Explore runtimes

After creating your flow, and configuring the necessary connections your tools use, you want to run your flow. To run the flow, you need compute, which is offered through prompt flow **runtimes**.

![Diagram runtimes, compute, and environments in relation to flows.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-prompt-flow-ai-studio/media/runtimes.png)

Runtimes (1) are a combination of a **compute instance** (2) providing the necessary compute resources, and an **environment** (3) specifying the necessary packages and libraries that need to be installed before being able to run the flow.

When you use runtimes, you have a controlled environment where flows can be run and validated, ensuring that everything works as intended in a stable setting. A default environment is available for quick development and testing. When you require other packages to be installed, you can [create a custom environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/how-to-customize-environment-runtime).

### Explore variants and monitoring options
During production, you want to optimize and deploy your flow. Finally, you want to monitor your flows to understand when improving your flows is necessary.

You can optimize your flow by using **variants**, you can deploy your flow to an **endpoint**, and you can monitor your flow by evaluating key metrics.

#### Explore variants

Prompt flow **variants** are versions of a tool node with distinct settings. Currently, variants are only supported in the LLM tool, where a variant can represent a different prompt content or connection setting. Variants allow users to customize their approach for specific tasks, like, summarizing news articles.

Some benefits of using variants are:

- **Enhance the quality of your LLM generation**: Creating diverse variants of an LLM node helps find the best prompt and settings for high-quality content.
- **Save time and effort**: Variants allow for easy management and comparison of different prompt versions, streamlining historical tracking and reducing the effort in prompt tuning.
- **Boost productivity**: They simplify the optimization of LLM nodes, enabling quicker creation and management of variations, leading to better results in less time.
- **Facilitate easy comparison**: Variants enable side-by-side result comparisons, aiding in choosing the most effective variant based on data-driven decisions.

#### Deploy your flow to an endpoint

When you're satisfied with the performance of your flow, you can choose to deploy it to an **online endpoint**. Endpoints are URLs that you can call from any application. When you make an API call to an online endpoint, you can expect (almost) immediate response.

When you deploy your flow to an online endpoint, prompt flow generates a URL and key so you can safely integrate your flow with other applications or business processes. When you invoke the endpoint, a flow is run and the output is returned in real-time. As a result, deploying flows to endpoints can for example generate chat or agentic responses that you want to return in another application.

#### Monitor evaluation metrics

In prompt flow, monitoring evaluation metrics is key to understanding your LLM application's performance, ensuring they meet real-world expectations and deliver accurate results.

To understand whether your application is meeting practical needs, you can collect end-user feedback and assess the application's usefulness. Another approach to understanding whether your application is performing well, is by comparing LLM predictions with expected or _ground truth_ responses to gauge accuracy and relevance. Evaluating the LLM's predictions is crucial for keeping LLM applications reliable and effective.

##### Metrics

The key metrics used for monitoring evaluation in prompt flow each offer unique insight into the performance of LLMs:

- _**Groundedness**_: Measures alignment of the LLM application's output with the input source or database.
- _**Relevance**_: Assesses how pertinent the LLM application's output is to the given input.
- _**Coherence**_: Evaluates the logical flow and readability of the LLM application's text.
- _**Fluency**_: Assesses the grammatical and linguistic accuracy of the LLM application's output.
- _**Similarity**_: Quantifies the contextual and semantic match between the LLM application's output and the ground truth.

Metrics like _groundedness_, _relevance_, _coherence_, _fluency_, and _similarity_ are key for quality assurance, ensuring that interactions with your LLM applications are accurate and effective. Whenever your LLM application doesn't perform as expected, you need to revert back to experimentation to iteratively explore how to improve your flow.
### Develop generative AI solutions in Azure

#### Use a prompt flow to manage conversation in a chat app

In this exercise, you’ll use Azure AI Foundry portal’s prompt flow to create a custom chat app that uses a user prompt and chat history as inputs, and uses a GPT model from Azure OpenAI to generate an output.

    - **Connected AI resource**: _Select your Azure OpenAI resource connection_
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 50K _(or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K)_
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    
    > **Note**: Reducing the TPM helps avoid over-using the quota available in the subscription you are using. 50,000 TPM should be sufficient for the data used in this exercise. If your available quota is lower than this, you will be able to complete the exercise but you may experience errors if the rate limit is exceeded.
    
5. Wait for the deployment to complete.

#### Create a prompt flow

A prompt flow provides a way to orchestrate prompts and other activities to define an interaction with a generative AI model. In this exercise, you’ll use a template to create a basic chat flow for an AI assistant in a travel agency.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal navigation bar, in the **Build and customize** section, select **Prompt flow**.
2. Create a new flow based on the **Chat flow** template, specifying `Travel-Chat` as the folder name.
    
    A simple chat flow is created for you.
    
    > **Tip**: If a permissions error occurs. Wait a few minutes and try again, specifying a different flow name if necessary.
    
3. To be able to test your flow, you need compute, and it can take a while to start; so select **Start compute session** to get it started while you explore and modify the default flow.
    
4. View the prompt flow, which consists of a series of _inputs_, _outputs_, and _tools_. You can expand and edit the properties of these objects in the editing panes on the left, and view the overall flow as a graph on the right:
    
    [![Screenshot of the prompt flow editor.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/prompt-flow.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/prompt-flow.png)
    
5. View the **Inputs** pane, and note that there are two inputs (chat history and the user’s question)
6. View the **Outputs** pane and note that there’s an output to reflect the model’s answer.
7. View the **Chat** LLM tool pane, which contains the information needed to submit a prompt to the model.
8. In the **Chat** LLM tool pane, for **Connection**, select the connection for the Azure OpenAI service resource in your AI hub. Then configure the following connection properties:
    - **Api**: chat
    - **deployment_name**: _The gpt-4o model you deployed_
    - **response_format**: {“type”:”text”}
9. Modify the **Prompt** field as follows:
    
    ```yml
    # system:
    **Objective**: Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.
    
    **Capabilities**:
    - Provide up-to-date travel information, including destinations, accommodations, transportation, and local attractions.
    - Offer personalized travel suggestions based on user preferences, budget, and travel dates.
    - Share tips on packing, safety, and navigating travel disruptions.
    - Help with itinerary planning, including optimal routes and must-see landmarks.
    - Answer common travel questions and provide solutions to potential travel issues.
    
    **Instructions**:
    1. Engage with the user in a friendly and professional manner, as a travel agent would.
    2. Use available resources to provide accurate and relevant travel information.
    3. Tailor responses to the user's specific travel needs and interests.
    4. Ensure recommendations are practical and consider the user's safety and comfort.
    5. Encourage the user to ask follow-up questions for further assistance.
    
       
    
    # user:
       
    ```
    
    Read the prompt you added so you are familiar with it. It consists of a system message (which includes an objective, a definition of its capabilities, and some instructions), and the chat history (ordered to show each user question input and each previous assistant answer output)
    
10. In the **Inputs** section for the **Chat** LLM tool (under the prompt), ensure the following variables are set:
    - **question** (string): ${inputs.question}
    - **chat_history** (string): ${inputs.chat_history}
11. Save the changes to the flow.
    
    > **Note**: In this exercise, we’ll stick to a simple chat flow, but note that the prompt flow editor includes many other tools that you could add to the flow, enabling you to create complex logic to orchstrate conversations.
    

#### Test the flow

Now that you’ve developed the flow, you can use the chat window to test it.

1. Ensure the compute session is running. If not, wait for it to start.
2. On the toolbar, select **Chat** to open the **Chat** pane, and wait for the chat to initialize.
3. Enter the query: `I have one day in London, what should I do?` and review the output. The Chat pane should look similar to this:
    
    [![Screenshot of the prompt flow chat pane.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/prompt-flow-chat.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/prompt-flow-chat.png)
    

#### Deploy the flow

When you’re satisfied with the behavior of the flow you created, you can deploy the flow.

        - _Use the default settings_
2. In Azure AI Foundry portal, in the navigation pane, in the **My assets** section, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
    
    If the page opens for your gpt-4o model, use its **back** button to view all models and endpoints.
    
3. Initially, the page may show only your model deployments. It may take some time before the deployment is listed, and even longer before it’s successfully created.
4. When the deployment has _succeeded_, select it. Then, view its **Test** page.
    
    > **Tip**: If the test page describes the endpoint as unhealthy, return to the **models and endpoints** and wait a minute or so before refreshing the view and selecting the endpoint again.
    
5. Enter the prompt `What is there to do in San Francisco?` and review the response.
6. Enter the prompt `Tell me something about the history of the city.` and review the response.
    
    The test pane should look similar to this:
    
    [![Screenshot of the deployed prompt flow endpoint test page.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/deployed-flow.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/deployed-flow.png)
    
7. View the **Consume** page for the endpoint, and note that it contains connection information and sample code that you can use to build a client application for your endpoint - enabling you to integrate the prompt flow solution into an application as a generative AI application.

#### Clean up

- Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Develop a RAG-based solution with your own data using Azure AI Foundry
### Introduction

Language models are growing in popularity as they create impressive coherent answers to a user’s questions. Especially when a user interacts with a language model through chat, it provides an intuitive way to get the information they need.

One prevalent challenge when implementing language models through chat is the so-called **groundedness**, which refers to whether a response is rooted, connected, or anchored in reality or a specific context. In other words, groundedness refers to whether the response of a language model is based on factual information.

#### Ungrounded prompts and responses

When you use a language model to generate a response to a prompt, the only information that the model has to base the answer on comes from the data on which it was trained - which is often just a large volume of uncontextualized text from the Internet or some other source.

![Diagram of an ungrounded model returning an uncontextualized response.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/ungrounded.png)

The result will likely be a grammatically coherent and logical response to the prompt, but because it isn't grounded in relevant, factual data, it's uncontextualized; and may in fact be inaccurate and include "invented" information. For example, the question "Which product should I use to do _X_?" might include details of a fictional product.

#### Grounded prompts and responses

In contrast, you can use a data source to _ground_ the prompt with some relevant, factual context. The prompt can then be submitted to a language model, including the grounding data, to generate a contextualized, relevant, and accurate response.

![Diagram of a grounded model returning a contextualized response.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/grounded.png)

The data source can be any repository of relevant data. For example, you could use data from a product catalog database to ground the prompt "Which product should I use to do _X_?" so that the response includes relevant details of products that exist in the catalog.
### Understand how to ground your language model

Language models excel in generating engaging text, and are ideal as the base for agents. Agents provide users with an intuitive chat-based application to receive assistance in their work. When designing an agent for a specific use case, you want to ensure your language model is grounded and uses factual information that is relevant to what the user needs.

Though language models are trained on a vast amount of data, they may not have access to the knowledge you want to make available to your users. To ensure that an agent is grounded on specific data to provide accurate and domain-specific responses, you can use **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (**RAG**).

#### Understanding RAG

RAG is a technique that you can use to ground a language model. In other words, it's a process for retrieving information that is relevant to the user's initial prompt. In general terms, the RAG pattern incorporates the following steps:

![Diagram of the retrieval augmented generation pattern.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/rag-pattern.png)

1. **Retrieve** grounding data based on the initial user-entered prompt.
2. **Augment** the prompt with grounding data.
3. Use a language model to **generate** a grounded response.

By retrieving context from a specified data source, you ensure that the language model uses relevant information when responding, instead of relying on its training data.

Using RAG is a powerful and easy-to-use technique for many cases in which you want to ground your language model and improve the factual accuracy of your generative AI app's responses.

#### Adding grounding data to an Azure AI project

You can use Azure AI Foundry to build a custom age that uses your own data to ground prompts. Azure AI Foundry supports a range of data connections that you can use to add data to a project, including:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Microsoft OneLake

You can also upload files or folders to the storage used by your AI Foundry project.

![Screenshot of the Add Data dialog in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/add-data.png)
### Make your data searchable

When you want to create an agent that uses your own data to generate accurate answers, you need to be able to search your data efficiently. When you build an agent with the Azure AI Foundry, you can use the integration with **Azure AI Search** to retrieve the relevant context in your chat flow.

Azure AI Search is a **retriever** that you can include when building a language model application with prompt flow. Azure AI Search allows you to bring your own data, index your data, and query the index to retrieve any information you need.

![Diagram showing an index being queried to retrieve grounding data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/index.png)

#### Using a _vector_ index

While a text-based index will improve search efficiency, you can usually achieve a better data retrieval solution by using a _vector_-based index that contains _embeddings_ that represent the text tokens in your data source.

An embedding is a special format of data representation that a search engine can use to easily find the relevant information. More specifically, an embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers.

For example, imagine you have two documents with the following contents:

- _"The children played joyfully in the park."_
- _"Kids happily ran around the playground."_

These two documents contain texts that are semantically related, even though different words are used. By creating vector embeddings for the text in the documents, the relation between the words in the text can be mathematically calculated.

Imagine the keywords being extracted from the document and plotted as a vector in a multidimensional space:

![Diagram of vector embeddings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/vector-embeddings.jpg)

The distance between vectors can be calculated by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors, also known as the _cosine similarity_. In other words, the cosine similarity computes the semantic similarity between documents and a query.

By representing words and their meanings with vectors, you can extract relevant context from your data source even when your data is stored in different formats (text or image) and languages.

When you want to be able to use vector search to search your data, you need to create embeddings when creating your search index. To create embeddings for your search index, you can use an Azure OpenAI embedding model available in Azure AI Foundry.

![Diagram showing a vector index that contains embeddings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/vector-index.png)

>**Tip**: Learn more about [embeddings in the Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings).

#### Creating a search index

In Azure AI Search, a **search index** describes how your content is organized to make it searchable. Imagine a library containing many books. You want to be able to search through the library and retrieve the relevant book easily and efficiently. To make the library searchable, you create a catalog that contains any relevant data about books to make any book easy to find. A library’s catalog serves as the search index.

Though there are different approaches to creating an index, the integration of Azure AI Search in Azure AI Foundry makes it easy for you to create an index that is suitable for language models. You can add your data to Azure AI Foundry, after which you can use Azure AI Search to create an index in the Azure AI Foundry portal using an embedding model. The index asset is stored in Azure AI Search and queried by Azure AI Foundry when used in a chat flow.

![Screenshot of creating an index in Azure AI Foundry.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/create-index.png)

How you configure your search index depends on the data you have and the context you want your language model to use. For example, **keyword search** enables you to retrieve information that exactly matches the search query. **Semantic search** already takes it one step further by retrieving information that matches the meaning of the query instead of the exact keyword, using semantic models. Currently, the most advanced technique is **vector search**, which creates embeddings to represent your data.

>**Tip**: Learn more about [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview).

#### Searching an index

There are several ways that information can be queried in an index:

- **Keyword search**: Identifies relevant documents or passages based on specific keywords or terms provided as input.
- **Semantic search**: Retrieves documents or passages by understanding the meaning of the query and matching it with semantically related content rather than relying solely on exact keyword matches.
- **Vector search**: Uses mathematical representations of text (vectors) to find similar documents or passages based on their semantic meaning or context.
- **Hybrid search**: Combines any or all of the other search techniques. Queries are executed in parallel and are returned in a unified result set.

When you create a search index in Azure AI Foundry, you're guided to configuring an index that is most suitable to use in combination with a language model. When your search results are used in a generative AI application, hybrid search gives the most accurate results.

Hybrid search is a combination of keyword (and full text), and vector search, to which semantic ranking is optionally added. When you create an index that is compatible with hybrid search, the retrieved information is precise when exact matches are available (using keywords), and still relevant when only conceptually similar information can be found (using vector search).

>**Tip**: Learn more about [hybrid search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview).lient application

### Create a RAG-based client application

When you've created an Azure AI Search index for your contextual data, you can use it with an OpenAI model. To ground prompts with data from your index, the Azure OpenAI SDK supports extending the request with connection details for the index. The pattern for using this approach when working with an Azure AI Foundry project is shown in the following diagram.

![Diagram of a client app using an Azure AI Search index to ground a prompt for an OpenAI model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/client-app.png)

1. Use an Azure AI Foundry project client to retrieve connection details for the Azure AI Search index and an OpenAI **ChatClient** object.
2. Add the index connection information to the **ChatClient** configuration so that it can be searched for grounding data based on the user prompt.
3. Submit the grounded prompt to the Azure OpenAI model to generate a contextualized response.

The following code example shows how to implement this pattern.

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# Get an Azure OpenAI chat client
chat_client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version = "2024-12-01-preview",
    azure_endpoint = open_ai_endpoint,
    api_key = open_ai_key
)

# Initialize prompt with system message
prompt = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."}
]

# Add a user input message to the prompt
input_text = input("Enter a question: ")
prompt.append({"role": "user", "content": input_text})

# Additional parameters to apply RAG pattern using the AI Search index
rag_params = {
    "data_sources": [
        {
            "type": "azure_search",
            "parameters": {
                "endpoint": search_url,
                "index_name": "index_name",
                "authentication": {
                    "type": "api_key",
                    "key": search_key,
                }
            }
        }
    ],
}

# Submit the prompt with the index information
response = chat_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="<model_deployment_name>",
    messages=prompt,
    extra_body=rag_params
)

# Print the contextualized response
completion = response.choices[0].message.content
print(completion)
```

In this example, the search against the index is _keyword-based_ - in other words, the query consists of the text in the user prompt, which is matched to text in the indexed documents. When using an index that supports it, an alternative approach is to use a _vector-based_ query in which the index and the query use numeric vectors to represent text tokens. Searching with vectors enables matching based on semantic similarity as well as literal text matches.

To use a vector-based query, you can modify the specification of the Azure AI Search data source details to include an embedding model; which is then used to vectorize the query text.

```python
rag_params = {
    "data_sources": [
        {
            "type": "azure_search",
            "parameters": {
                "endpoint": search_url,
                "index_name": "index_name",
                "authentication": {
                    "type": "api_key",
                    "key": search_key,
                },
                # Params for vector-based query
                "query_type": "vector",
                "embedding_dependency": {
                    "type": "deployment_name",
                    "deployment_name": "<embedding_model_deployment_name>",
                },
            }
        }
    ],
}
```
### Implement RAG in a prompt flow

After uploading data to Azure AI Foundry and creating an index on your data using the integration with Azure AI Search, you can implement the RAG pattern with _Prompt Flow_ to build a generative AI application.

**Prompt Flow** is a development framework for defining flows that orchestrate interactions with an LLM.

![Diagram of a prompt flow.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/prompt-flow.png)

A flow begins with one or more _inputs_, usually a question or prompt entered by a user, and in the case of iterative conversations the chat history to this point.

The flow is then defined as a series of connected _tools_, each of which performs a specific operation on the inputs and other environmental variables. There are multiple types of tool that you can include in a prompt flow to perform tasks such as:

- Running custom Python code
- Looking up data values in an index
- Creating prompt variants - enabling you to define multiple versions of a prompt for a large language model (LLM), varying system messages or prompt wording, and compare and evaluate the results from each variant.
- Submitting a prompt to an LLM to generate results.

Finally, the flow has one or more _outputs_, typically to return the generated results from an LLM.

#### Using the RAG pattern in a prompt flow

The key to using the RAG pattern in a prompt flow is to use an Index Lookup tool to retrieve data from an index so that subsequent tools in the flow can use the results to augment the prompt used to generate output from an LLM.

![Diagram of a prompt flow with an Index Lookup tool.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/rag-prompt-flow.png)

#### Use a sample to create a chat flow

Prompt flow provides various samples you can use as a starting point to create an application. When you want to combine RAG and a language model in your application, you can clone the **Multi-round Q&A on your data** sample.

The sample contains the necessary elements to include RAG and a language model:

![Screenshot of the chat flow created with the Q&A sample.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/build-copilot-ai-studio/media/chat-flow.png)

1. Append the history to the chat input to define a prompt in the form of a contextualized form of a question.
2. Look up relevant information from your data using your search index.
3. Generate the prompt context by using the retrieved data from the index to augment the question.
4. Create prompt variants by adding a system message and structuring the chat history.
5. Submit the prompt to a language model that generates a natural language response.

Let's explore each of these elements in more detail.

##### Modify query with history

The first step in the flow is a Large Language Model (LLM) node that takes the chat history and the user's last question and generates a new question that includes all necessary information. By doing so, you generate more succinct input that is processed by the rest of the flow.

##### Look up relevant information

Next, you use the Index Lookup tool to query the search index you created with the integrated Azure AI Search feature and find the relevant information from your data source.

>**Tip**: Learn more about the [Index Lookup tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/tools-reference/index-lookup-tool).

##### Generate prompt context

The output of the Index Lookup tool is the retrieved context you want to use when generating a response to the user. You want to use the output in a prompt that is sent to a language model, which means you want to parse the output into a more suitable format.

The output of the Index Lookup tool can include the top _n_ results (depending on the parameters you set). When you generate the prompt context, you can use a Python node to iterate over the retrieved documents from your data source and combine their contents and sources into one document string. The string will be used in the prompt you send to the language model in the next step of the flow.

##### Define prompt variants

When you construct the prompt you want to send to your language model, you can use variants to represent different prompt contents.

When including RAG in your chat flow, your goal is to ground the chatbot's responses. Next to retrieving relevant context from your data source, you can also influence the groundedness of the chatbot's response by instructing it to use the context and aim to be factual.

With the prompt variants, you can provide varying system messages in the prompt to explore which content provides the most groundedness.

##### Chat with context

Finally, you use an LLM node to send the prompt to a language model to generate a response using the relevant context retrieved from your data source. The response from this node is also the output of the entire flow.

After configuring the sample chat flow to use your indexed data and the language model of your choosing, you can deploy the flow and integrate it with an application to offer users an agentic experience.
### Create a generative AI app that uses your own data

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to build applications that integrate data from custom data sources into a prompt for a generative AI model. RAG is a commonly used pattern for developing generative AI apps - chat-based applications that use a language model to interpret inputs and generate appropriate responses.

In this exercise, you’ll use Azure AI Foundry to integrate custom data into a generative AI solution.

This exercise takes approximately **45** minutes.

> **Note**: This exercise is based on pre-release services, which may be subject to change.

#### Create an Azure AI Foundry hub and project

The features of Azure AI Foundry we’re going to use in this exercise require a project that is based on an Azure AI Foundry _hub_ resource.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it’s open):
    
    [![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)
    
2. In the browser, navigate to `https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources` and select **Create new**. Then choose the option to create a new **AI hub resource**.
3. In the **Create a project** wizard, enter a valid name for your project, and select the option to create a new hub. Then use the **Rename hub** link to specify a valid name for your new hub, expand **Advanced options**, and specify the following settings for your project:
    
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_
    - **Region**: East US 2 or Sweden Central (_In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, you may need to create another resource in a different region._)
    
    > **Note**: If you’re working in an Azure subscription in which policies are used to restrict allowable resource names, you may need to use the link at the bottom of the **Create a new project** dialog box to create the hub using the Azure portal.
    
    > **Tip**: If the **Create** button is still disabled, be sure to rename your hub to a unique alphanumeric value.
    
4. Wait for your project to be created, and then navigate to your project.

#### Deploy models

You need two models to implement your solution:

- An _embedding_ model to vectorize text data for efficient indexing and processing.
- A model that can generate natural language responses to questions based on your data.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, in your project, in the navigation pane on the left, under **My assets**, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
2. Create a new deployment of the **text-embedding-ada-002** model with the following settings by selecting **Customize** in the Deploy model wizard:
    
    - **Deployment name**: _A valid name for your model deployment_
    - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
    - **Model version**: _Select the default version_
    - **Connected AI resource**: _Select the resource created previously_
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 50K _(or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K)_
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    
    > **Note**: If your current AI resource location doesn’t have quota available for the model you want to deploy, you will be asked to choose a different location where a new AI resource will be created and connected to your project.
    
3. Return to the **Models + endpoints** page and repeat the previous steps to deploy a **gpt-4o** model using a **Global Standard** deployment of the most recent version with a TPM rate limit of **50K** (or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K).
    
    > **Note**: Reducing the Tokens Per Minute (TPM) helps avoid over-using the quota available in the subscription you are using. 50,000 TPM is sufficient for the data used in this exercise.
    

#### Add data to your project

The data for your app consists of a set of travel brochures in PDF format from the fictitious travel agency _Margie’s Travel_. Let’s add them to the project.

1. In a new browser tab, download the [zipped archive of brochures](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/raw/main/data/brochures.zip) from `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/raw/main/data/brochures.zip` and extract it to a folder named **brochures** on your local file system.
2. In Azure AI Foundry portal, in your project, in the navigation pane on the left, under **My assets**, select the **Data + indexes** page.
3. Select **+ New data**.
4. In the **Add your data** wizard, expand the drop-down menu to select **Upload files/folders**.
5. Select **Upload folder** and upload the **brochures** folder. Wait until all the files in the folder are listed.
6. Select **Next** and set the data name to `brochures`.
7. Wait for the folder to be uploaded and note that it contains several .pdf files.

#### Create an index for your data

Now that you’ve added a data source to your project, you can use it to create an index in your Azure AI Search resource.

1. In Azure AI Foundry portal, in your project, in the navigation pane on the left, under **My assets**, select the **Data + indexes** page.
2. In the **Indexes** tab, add a new index with the following settings:
    - **Source location**:
        - **Data source**: Data in Azure AI Foundry
            - _Select the **brochures** data source_
    - **Index configuration**:
        - **Select Azure AI Search service**: _Create a new Azure AI Search resource with the following settings_:
            
            - **Subscription**: _You Azure subscription_
            - **Resource group**: _The same resource group as your AI hub_
            - **Service name**: _A valid name for your AI Search Resource_
            - **Location**: _The same location as your AI hub_
            - **Pricing tier**: Basic
            
            Wait for the AI Search resource to be created. Then return to the Azure AI Foundry and finish configuring the index by selecting **Connect other Azure AI Search resource** and adding a connection to the AI Search resource you just created.
            
        - **Vector index**: `brochures-index`
        - **Virtual machine**: Auto select
    - **Search settings**:
        - **Vector settings**: Add vector search to this search resource
        - **Azure OpenAI connection**: _Select the default Azure OpenAI resource for your hub._
        - **Embedding model**: text-embedding-ada-002
        - **Embedding model deployment**: _Your deployment of the_ text-embedding-ada-002 _model_
3. Create the vector index and wait for the indexing process to be completed, which can take a while depending on available compute resources in your subscription.
    
    The index creation operation consists of the following jobs:
    
    - Crack, chunk, and embed the text tokens in your brochures data.
    - Create the Azure AI Search index.
    - Register the index asset.
    
    > **Tip**: While you’re waiting for the index to be created, why not take a look at the brochures you downloaded to get familiar with their contents?
    

#### Test the index in the playground

Before using your index in a RAG-based prompt flow, let’s verify that it can be used to affect generative AI responses.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, select the **Playgrounds** page and open the **Chat** playground.
2. On the Chat playground page, in the Setup pane, ensure that your **gpt-4o** model deployment is selected. Then, in the main chat session panel, submit the prompt `Where can I stay in New York?`
3. Review the response, which should be a generic answer from the model without any data from the index.
4. In the Setup pane, expand the **Add your data** field, and then add the **brochures-index** project index and select the **hybrid (vector + keyword)** search type.
    
    > **Tip**: In some cases, newly created indexes may not be available right away. Refreshing the browser usually helps, but if you’re still experiencing the issue where it can’t find the index you may need to wait until the index is recognized.
    
5. After the index has been added and the chat session has restarted, resubmit the prompt `Where can I stay in New York?`
6. Review the response, which should be based on data in the index.

#### Create a RAG client app

Now that you have a working index, you can use the Azure OpenAI SDK to implement the RAG pattern in a client application. Let’s explore the code to accomplish this in a simple example.

> **Tip**: You can choose to develop your RAG solution using Python or Microsoft C#. Follow the instructions in the appropriate section for your chosen language.

##### Prepare the application configuration

1. Return to the browser tab containing the Azure portal (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab).
2. Use the **[>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a **_PowerShell_** environment with no storage in your subscription.
    
    The cloud shell provides a command-line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal. You can resize or maximize this pane to make it easier to work in.
    
    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a _Bash_ environment, switch it to **_PowerShell_**.
    
3. In the cloud shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version** (this is required to use the code editor).
    
    **Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell before continuing.**
    
4. In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise (type the command, or copy it to the clipboard and then right-click in the command line and paste as plain text):
    
    ```bash
     rm -r mslearn-ai-foundry -f
     git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-ai-studio mslearn-ai-foundry
    ```
    
    > **Tip**: As you paste commands into the cloudshell, the output may take up a large amount of the screen buffer. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.
    
5. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the chat application code files:
    
    > **Note**: Follow the steps for your chosen programming language.
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    cd mslearn-ai-foundry/labfiles/rag-app/python
    ```
    
    
6. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the OpenAI SDK library:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv labenv
    ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt openai
    ```
    
    
7. Enter the following command to edit the configuration file that has been provided:
    
    **Python**
    
    
    ```bash
    code .env
    ```
    
    
    The file is opened in a code editor.
    
8. In the code file, replace the following placeholders:
    - **your_openai_endpoint**: The Open AI endpoint from your project’s **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal (be sure to select the **Azure OpenAI** capability tab, not the Azure AI Inference or Azure AI Services capability).
    - **your_openai_api_key** The Open AI API key from your project’s **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal (be sure to select the **Azure OpenAI** capability tab, not the Azure AI Inference or Azure AI Services capability).
    - **your_chat_model**: The name you assigned to your **gpt-4o** model deployment, from the **Models + endpoints** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal (the default name is `gpt-4o`).
    - **your_embedding_model**: The name you assigned to your **text-embedding-ada-002** model deployment, from the **Models + endpoints** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal (the default name is `text-embedding-ada-002`).
    - **your_search_endpoint**: The URL for your Azure AI Search resource. You’ll find this in the **Management center** in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
    - **your_search_api_key**: The API key for your Azure AI Search resource. You’ll find this in the **Management center** in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
    - **your_index**: Replace with your index name from the **Data + indexes** page for your project in the Azure AI Foundry portal (it should be `brochures-index`).
9. After you’ve replaced the placeholders, in the code editor, use the **CTRL+S** command or **Right-click > Save** to save your changes and then use the **CTRL+Q** command or **Right-click > Quit** to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

##### Explore code to implement the RAG pattern

1. Enter the following command to edit the code file that has been provided:
    
    **Python**
    
    
    ```bash
    code rag-app.py
    ```
    
    
2. Review the code in the file, noting that it:
    
    - Creates an Azure OpenAI client using the endpoint, key, and chat model.
    - Creates a suitable system message for a travel-related chat solution.
    - Submits a prompt (including the system and a user message based on the user input) to the Azure OpenAI client, adding:
        - Connection details for the Azure AI Search index to be queried.
        - Details of the embedding model to be used to vectorize the query*.
    - Displays the response from the grounded prompt.
    - Adds the response to the chat history.
    
    * _The query for the search index is based on the prompt, and is used to find relevant text in the indexed documents. You can use a keyword-based search that submits the query as text, but using a vector-based search can be more efficient - hence the use of an embedding model to vectorize the query text before submitting it._
    
3. Use the **CTRL+Q** command to close the code editor without saving any changes, while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

##### Run the chat application

1. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to run the app:
    
    **Python**
    
    ```bash
    python rag-app.py
    ```
    
    
    > **Tip**: If a compilation error occurs because .NET version 9.0 is not installed, use the `dotnet --version` command to determine the version of .NET installed in your environment and then edit the **rag_app.csproj** file in the code folder to update the **TargetFramework** setting accordingly.
    
2. When prompted, enter a question, such as `Where should I go on vacation to see architecture?` and review the response from your generative AI model.
    
    Note that the response includes source references to indicate the indexed data in which the answer was found.
    
3. Try a follow-up question, for example `Where can I stay there?`
    
4. When you’re finished, enter `quit` to exit the program. Then close the cloud shell pane.
    

#### Clean up

To avoid unnecessary Azure costs and resource utilization, you should remove the resources you deployed in this exercise.

1. If you’ve finished exploring Azure AI Foundry, return to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) at `https://portal.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials if necessary. Then delete the resources in the resource group where you provisioned your Azure AI Search and Azure AI resources.


## Fine-tune a language model with Azure AI Foundry
### Introduction

Language models are pretrained models that provide you with a great starting point. By using one of the available base or foundation models, you can save time and effort as you need less data to train a model for your specific use case.

Imagine you're a developer working for a travel agency. When customers use your chat application to get help with their travel-related questions, you want the responses to be in a specific format and style. Your company has a specific tone of voice that resonates with your client base. The marketing department finds it important that the chat application is aligned with your company's tone of voice too.

There are various strategies to optimize the model's behavior and the performance of your chat application. One strategy is to fine-tune a language model, which you can then integrate with your chat application. The benefit of fine-tuning over training your own language model, is that you need less time, compute resources, and data to customize the model to your needs.

### Understand when to fine-tune a language model

Before you start fine-tuning a model, you need to have a clear understanding of what fine-tuning is and when you should use it.

When you want to develop a chat application with Azure AI Foundry, you can use prompt flow to create a chat application that is integrated with a language model to generate responses. To improve the quality of the responses the model generates, you can try various strategies. The easiest strategy is to apply **prompt engineering**. You can change the way you format your question, but you can also update the **system message** that is sent along with the prompt to the language model.

Prompt engineering is a quick and easy way to improve _how the model acts_, and _what the model needs to know_. When you want to improve the quality of the model even further, there are two common techniques that are used:

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (**RAG**): Ground your data by first retrieving context from a data source before generating a response.
- **Fine-tuning**: Train a base language model on a dataset before integrating it in your application.

![Diagram showing the various strategies to optimize the model's performance.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/finetune-model-copilot-ai-studio/media/model-optimization.png)

RAG is most commonly applied when you need the model's responses to be factual and _grounded_ in specific data. For example, you want customers to ask questions about hotels that you're offering in your travel booking catalog. On the other hand, when you want the model to behave a certain way, fine-tuning can help you achieve your goal. You can also use a combination of optimization strategies, like RAG _and_ a fine-tuned model, to improve your language application.

How the model needs to act mostly relates to the style, format, and tone of the responses generated by a model. When you want your model to adhere to a specific style and format when responding, you can instruct the model to do so through prompt engineering too. Sometimes however, prompt engineering might not lead to consistent results. It can still happen that a model _ignores_ your instructions and behaves differently.

Within prompt engineering, a technique used to _"force"_ the model to generate output in a specific format, is to provide the model with various examples of what the desired output might look like, also known as **one-shot** (one example) or **few-shot** (few examples). Still, it can happen that your model doesn't always generate the output in the style and format you specified.

To maximize the **consistency of the model's behavior**, you can **fine-tune a base model** with your own training data.

### Prepare your data to fine-tune a chat completion model

Fine-tuning involves combining a suitable _foundation_ model to use as a base, and with a set of _training data_ that includes example prompts and responses that the model can learn from.

![Diagram of a base model plus training data resulting in a fine-tuned model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/finetune-model-copilot-ai-studio/media/fine-tuning.png)

When you decide you want to fine-tune a language model, you need to identify the dataset you can use to fine-tune your language model.

Similar to any machine learning model, the quality of the dataset has a large effect on the quality of your model. Though you need less data than when you would train a language model from scratch, you still might need enough data to maximize the consistency of your desired model's behavior. How much data you need depends on your use case.

When you fine-tune a language model for chat completion, the data you use to fine-tune a model is a collection of sample conversations. More specifically, the data should contain three components:

- The system message
- The user message
- The assistant's response

The three variables come together in a JSON Lines or JSONL file. For example, one line in such a dataset might look like:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an Xbox customer support agent whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their Xbox devices. You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is Xbox better than PlayStation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but I cannot provide personal opinions. My primary job is to assist you with any issues related to your Xbox device. Do you have any Xbox-related issues that need addressing?"}]}
```

The dataset should show the model's ideal behavior. You can create this dataset based on the chat history of a chat application you have. A few things to keep in mind when you use real data is to:

- Remove any personal or sensitive information.
- Not only focus on creating a large training dataset, but also ensure your dataset includes a diverse set of examples.

You can include multiple turns of a conversation on a single line in the dataset. If you want to fine-tune only on specific assistant messages, you can optionally use the `weight` key-value pair. When the weight is set to 0, the message is ignored, when you set to 1, the message is included for training.

An example of a multi-turn chat file format with weights:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you be more sarcastic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.", "weight": 1}]}
```

When preparing your dataset to fine-tune a language model, you should understand your desired model behaviors, create a dataset in JSONL format, and ensure the examples you include are high quality and diverse. By preparing your dataset, you have a higher chance that the fine-tuned model improves your chat application's performance.

### Explore fine-tuning language models in Azure AI Studio

When you want to fine-tune a language model, you can use a base or foundation model that is already pretrained on large amounts of data. There are many foundation models available through the model catalog in the Azure AI Studio. You can fine-tune base models on various tasks, like text classification, translation, or chat completion.

When you want to use a fine-tuned model to generate responses in a chat application, you need to use a base model that can be fine-tuned on a chat completion task. The Azure AI Studio model catalog allows you to filter based on fine-tuning tasks to decide which base model to select. You can, for example, select a GPT-4 or Llama-2-7b model to fine-tune on your own training data.

To fine-tune a language model from Azure AI Foundry's model catalog, you can use the user interface provided in the portal.

#### Select the base model

When you navigate to the model catalog in the Azure AI Foundry portal, you can explore all available language models.

>**Note**: Though all available language models will appear in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog, you might not be able to fine-tune the model you want depending on the available quota. Ensure the model you want to fine-tune is available in the region you created your AI hub in.

You can filter the available models based on the task you want to fine-tune a model for. Per task, you have several options for foundation models to choose from. When deciding between foundation models for a task, you can examine the description of the model, and the referenced model card.

Some considerations you can take into account when deciding on a foundation model before fine-tuning are:

- **Model capabilities**: Evaluate the capabilities of the foundation model and how well they align with your task. For example, a model like BERT is better at understanding short texts.
- **Pretraining data**: Consider the dataset used for pretraining the foundation model. For example, GPT-2 is trained on unfiltered content from the internet that can result in biases.
- **Limitations and biases**: Be aware of any limitations or biases that might be present in the foundation model.
- **Language support**: Explore which models offer the specific language support or multilingual capabilities that you need for your use case.

>**Tip**: Though the Azure AI Foundry portal provides you with descriptions for each foundation model in the model catalog, you can also find more information about each model through the respective model card. The model cards are referenced in the overview of each model and hosted on [the website of Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).

#### Configure the fine-tuning job

To configure a fine-tuning job using the Azure AI Foundry portal, you need to do the following steps:

1. Select a base model.
2. Select your training data.
3. _(Optional)_ Select your validation data.
4. Configure the advanced options.

When you submit a model for fine-tuning, the model is further trained on your data. To configure the fine-tuning or training job, you can specify the following advanced options:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|batch_size|The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. In general, larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets. The default value and the maximum value for this property are specific to a base model. A larger batch size means that model parameters are updated less frequently, but with lower variance.|
|learning_rate_multiplier|The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pretraining multiplied by this value. Larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes. We recommend experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results. A smaller learning rate can be useful to avoid overfitting.|
|n_epochs|The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset.|
|seed|The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but can differ in rare cases. If a seed isn't specified, one is generated for you.|

After you submit the fine-tuning job, a job will be created to train your model. You can review the status of the job while it's running. After the job is completed, you can review the input parameters when you want to understand how the fine-tuned model was created.

If you added a validation dataset, you can review the model's performance by exploring how it performed on your validation dataset.

Alternatively, you can always deploy a fine-tuned model. After deploying the model, you can test it to assess its performance. When you're satisfied with your fine-tuned model, you can integrate the deployed model with your chat application.

### Fine-tune a language model

When you want a language model to behave a certain way, you can use prompt engineering to define the desired behavior. When you want to improve the consistency of the desired behavior, you can opt to fine-tune a model, comparing it to your prompt engineering approach to evaluate which method best fits your needs.

In this exercise, you’ll fine-tune a language model with the Azure AI Foundry that you want to use for a custom chat application scenario. You’ll compare the fine-tuned model with a base model to assess whether the fine-tuned model fits your needs better.

Imagine you work for a travel agency and you’re developing a chat application to help people plan their vacations. The goal is to create a simple and inspiring chat that suggests destinations and activities with a consistent, friendly conversational tone.

This exercise will take approximately **60** minutes*.

> * **Note**: This timing is an estimate based on the average experience. Fine-tuning is dependent on cloud infrastructure resources, which can take a variable amount of time to provision depending on data center capacity and concurrent demand. Some activities in this exercise may take a long time to complete, and require patience. If things are taking a while, consider reviewing the [Azure AI Foundry fine-tuning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/fine-tuning-overview) or taking a break. It is possible some processes may time-out or appear to run indefinitely. Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

#### Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

Let’s start by deploying a model in an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it’s open):
    
    [![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)
    
2. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the `gpt-4o` model; which we’ll use in our project.
3. In the search results, select the **gpt-4o** model to see its details, and then at the top of the page for the model, select **Use this model**.
4. When prompted to create a project, enter a valid name for your project and expand **Advanced options**.
5. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your project:
    
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: _A valid name for your Azure AI Foundry resource_
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_
    - **Region**: _Select one of the following regions_:*
        - East US 2
        - North Central US
        - Sweden Central
    
    > * At the time of writing, these regions support fine-tuning for gpt-4o models.
    
6. Select **Create** and wait for your project, including the gpt-4 model deployment you selected, to be created.
7. When your project is created, the chat playground will be opened automatically.
8. In the **Setup** pane, note the name of your model deployment; which should be **gpt-4o**. You can confirm this by viewing the deployment in the **Models and endpoints** page (just open that page in the navigation pane on the left).
9. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Overview** to see the main page for your project; which looks like this:
    
    [![Screenshot of a Azure AI Foundry project overview page.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-project.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-project.png)
    

#### Fine-tune a model

Because fine-tuning a model takes some time to complete, you’ll start the fine-tuning job now and come back to it after exploring the base gpt-4o model you already deployed.

1. Download the [training dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/refs/heads/main/data/travel-finetune-hotel.jsonl) at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/refs/heads/main/data/travel-finetune-hotel.jsonl`and save it as a JSONL file locally.
    
    > **Note**: Your device might default to saving the file as a .txt file. Select all files and remove the .txt suffix to ensure you’re saving the file as JSONL.
    
2. Navigate to the **Fine-tuning** page under the **Build and customize** section, using the menu on the left.
3. Select the button to add a new fine-tune model, select the **gpt-4o** model and then select **Next**.
4. **Fine-tune** the model using the following configuration:
    - **Method of customization**: Supervised
    - **Base model**: _Select the default version of **gpt-4o**_
    - **Training data**: _Select the option to **Add training data** and upload and apply the .jsonl file you downloaded previously_
    - **Model suffix**: `ft-travel`
    - **Seed**: *Random
5. Submit the fine-tuning details, and the job will start. It may take some time to complete. You can continue with the next section of the exercise while you wait.

> **Note**: Fine-tuning and deployment can take a significant amount of time (30 minutes or longer), so you may need to check back periodically. You can see more details of the progress so far by selecting the fine-tuning model job and viewing its **Logs** tab.

#### Chat with a base model

While you wait for the fine-tuning job to complete, let’s chat with a base GPT 4o model to assess how it performs.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Playgrounds** and open the **Chat playground**.
2. Verify your deployed **gpt-4o** base model is selected in setup pane.
3. In the chat window, enter the query `What can you do?` and view the response.
    
    The answers may be fairly generic. Remember we want to create a chat application that inspires people to travel.
    
4. Update the system message in the setup pane with the following prompt:
    
    ```
     You are an AI assistant that helps people plan their travel.
    ```
    
5. Select **Apply changes** to update the system message.
6. In the chat window, enter the query `What can you do?` again, and view the response. 1 As a response, the assistant may tell you that it can help you book flights, hotels and rental cars for your trip. You want to avoid this behavior.
    
7. Update the system message again with a new prompt:
    
    ```
     You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms.
     You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations.
     Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday.
    ```
    
    .
    
8. Continue testing your chat application to verify it doesn’t provide any information that isn’t grounded in retrieved data. For example, ask the following questions and review the model’s answers, paying particular attention to the tone and writing style that the model uses to respond:
    
    `Where in Rome should I stay?`
    
    `I'm mostly there for the food. Where should I stay to be within walking distance of affordable restaurants?`
    
    `What are some local delicacies I should try?`
    
    `When is the best time of year to visit in terms of the weather?`
    
    `What's the best way to get around the city?`
    

#### Review the training file

The base model seems to work well enough, but you may be looking for a particular conversational style from your generative AI app. The training data used for fine-tuning offers you the chance to create explicit examples of the kinds of response you want.

1. Open the JSONL file you downloaded previously (you can open it in any text editor)
2. Examine the list of the JSON documents in the training data file. The first one should be similar to this (formatted for readability):
    
    
    ```json
     {"messages": [
         {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms. You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations. Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday."},
         {"role": "user", "content": "What's a must-see in Paris?"},
         {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh la la! You simply must twirl around the Eiffel Tower and snap a chic selfie! After that, consider visiting the Louvre Museum to see the Mona Lisa and other masterpieces. What type of attractions are you most interested in?"}
         ]}
    ```
    
    Each example interaction in the list includes the same system message you tested with the base model, a user prompt related to a travel query, and a response. The style of the responses in the training data will help the fine-tuned model learn how it should respond.
    

#### Deploy the fine-tuned model

When fine-tuning has successfully completed, you can deploy the fine-tuned model.

1. Navigate to the **Fine-tuning** page under **Build and customize** to find your fine-tuning job and its status. If it’s still running, you can opt to continue chatting with your deployed base model or take a break. If it’s completed, you can continue.
    
    > **Tip**: Use the **Refresh** button in the fine-tuning page to refresh the view. If the fine-tuning job disappears entirely, refresh the page in the browser.
    
2. Select the fine-tuning job link to open its details page. Then, select the **Metrics** tab and explore the fine-tune metrics.
3. Deploy the fine-tuned model with the following configurations:
    - **Deployment name**: _A valid name for your model deployment_
    - **Deployment type**: Standard
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 50K _(or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K)_
    - **Content filter**: Default
4. Wait for the deployment to be complete before you can test it, this might take a while. Check the **Provisioning state** until it has succeeded (you may need to refresh the browser to see the updated status).

#### Test the fine-tuned model

Now that you deployed your fine-tuned model, you can test it like you tested your deployed base model.

1. When the deployment is ready, navigate to the fine-tuned model and select **Open in playground**.
2. Ensure the system message includes these instructions:
    
    
    ```
     You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms.
     You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations.
     Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday.
    ```
    
3. Test your fine-tuned model to assess whether its behavior is more consistent now. For example, ask the following questions again and explore the model’s answers:
    
    `Where in Rome should I stay?`
    
    `I'm mostly there for the food. Where should I stay to be within walking distance of affordable restaurants?`
    
    `What are some local delicacies I should try?`
    
    `When is the best time of year to visit in terms of the weather?`
    
    `What's the best way to get around the city?`
    
4. After reviewing the responses, how do they compare to those of the base model?

#### Clean up

If you’ve finished exploring Azure AI Foundry, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

- Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
- In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
- Select the resource group that you created for this exercise.
- At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
- Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Implement a responsible generative AI solution in Azure AI Foundry

### Introduction

Generative AI is one of the most powerful advances in technology ever. It enables developers to build applications that consume machine learning models trained with a large volume of data from across the Internet to generate new content that can be indistinguishable from content created by a human.

With such powerful capabilities, generative AI brings with it some dangers; and requires that data scientists, developers, and others involved in creating generative AI solutions adopt a responsible approach that identifies, measures, and mitigates risks.

### Plan a responsible generative AI solution

The Microsoft guidance for responsible generative AI is designed to be practical and actionable. It defines a four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models. The four stages in the process are:

1. _Map_ potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
2. _Measure_ the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
3. _Mitigate_ the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
4. _Manage_ the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.

>**Note**: These stages correspond closely to the functions in the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework).

The remainder of this module discusses each of these stages in detail, providing suggestions for actions you can take to implement a successful and responsible generative AI solution.

### Map potential harms

The first stage in a responsible generative AI process is to map the potential harms that could affect your planned solution. There are four steps in this stage, as shown here:

![Diagram showing steps to identify, prioritize, test, and share potential harms.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/responsible-ai-studio/media/identify-harms.png)

1. Identify potential harms
2. Prioritize identified harms
3. Test and verify the prioritized harms
4. Document and share the verified harms

#### 1: Identify potential harms

The potential harms that are relevant to your generative AI solution depend on multiple factors, including the specific services and models used to generate output as well as any fine-tuning or grounding data used to customize the outputs. Some common types of potential harm in a generative AI solution include:

- Generating content that is offensive, pejorative, or discriminatory.
- Generating content that contains factual inaccuracies.
- Generating content that encourages or supports illegal or unethical behavior or practices.

To fully understand the known limitations and behavior of the services and models in your solution, consult the available documentation. For example, the Azure OpenAI Service includes a [transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note); which you can use to understand specific considerations related to the service and the models it includes. Additionally, individual model developers may provide documentation such as the [OpenAI system card for the GPT-4 model](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf).

Consider reviewing the guidance in the [Microsoft Responsible AI Impact Assessment Guide](https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-RAI-Impact-Assessment-Guide.pdf) and using the associated [Responsible AI Impact Assessment template](https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-RAI-Impact-Assessment-Template.pdf) to document potential harms.

Review the [information and guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/responsible-use-of-ai-overview) for the resources you use to help identify potential harms.

#### 2: Prioritize the harms

For each potential harm you have identified, assess the likelihood of its occurrence and the resulting level of impact if it does. Then use this information to prioritize the harms with the most likely and impactful harms first. This prioritization will enable you to focus on finding and mitigating the most harmful risks in your solution.

The prioritization must take into account the intended use of the solution as well as the potential for misuse; and can be subjective. For example, suppose you're developing a smart kitchen copilot that provides recipe assistance to chefs and amateur cooks. Potential harms might include:

- The solution provides inaccurate cooking times, resulting in undercooked food that may cause illness.
- When prompted, the solution provides a recipe for a lethal poison that can be manufactured from everyday ingredients.

While neither of these outcomes is desirable, you may decide that the solution's potential to support the creation of a lethal poison has higher impact than the potential to create undercooked food. However, given the core usage scenario of the solution you may also suppose that the frequency with which inaccurate cooking times are suggested is likely to be much higher than the number of users explicitly asking for a poison recipe. The ultimate priority determination is a subject of discussion for the development team, which can involve consulting policy or legal experts in order to sufficiently prioritize.

#### 3: Test and verify the presence of harms

Now that you have a prioritized list, you can test your solution to verify that the harms occur; and if so, under what conditions. Your testing might also reveal the presence of previously unidentified harms that you can add to the list.

A common approach to testing for potential harms or vulnerabilities in a software solution is to use "red team" testing, in which a team of testers deliberately probes the solution for weaknesses and attempts to produce harmful results. Example tests for the smart kitchen copilot solution discussed previously might include requesting poison recipes or quick recipes that include ingredients that should be thoroughly cooked. The successes of the red team should be documented and reviewed to help determine the realistic likelihood of harmful output occurring when the solution is used.

>**Note**: _Red teaming_ is a strategy that is often used to find security vulnerabilities or other weaknesses that can compromise the integrity of a software solution. By extending this approach to find harmful content from generative AI, you can implement a responsible AI process that builds on and complements existing cybersecurity practices.

To learn more about Red Teaming for generative AI solutions, see [Introduction to red teaming large language models (LLMs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming) in the Azure OpenAI Service documentation.

#### 4: Document and share details of harms

When you have gathered evidence to support the presence of potential harms in the solution, document the details and share them with stakeholders. The prioritized list of harms should then be maintained and added to if new harms are identified.

### Measure potential harms

After compiling a prioritized list of potential harmful output, you can test the solution to measure the presence and impact of harms. Your goal is to create an initial baseline that quantifies the harms produced by your solution in given usage scenarios; and then track improvements against the baseline as you make iterative changes in the solution to mitigate the harms.

A generalized approach to measuring a system for potential harms consists of three steps:

![Diagram showing steps to prepare prompts, generate output, and measure harmful results.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/responsible-ai-studio/media/measure-harms.png)

1. Prepare a diverse selection of input prompts that are likely to result in each potential harm that you have documented for the system. For example, if one of the potential harms you have identified is that the system could help users manufacture dangerous poisons, create a selection of input prompts likely to elicit this result - such as _"How can I create an undetectable poison using everyday chemicals typically found in the home?"_
2. Submit the prompts to the system and retrieve the generated output.
3. Apply pre-defined criteria to evaluate the output and categorize it according to the level of potential harm it contains. The categorization may be as simple as "harmful" or "not harmful", or you may define a range of harm levels. Regardless of the categories you define, you must determine strict criteria that can be applied to the output in order to categorize it.

The results of the measurement process should be documented and shared with stakeholders.

#### Manual and automatic testing

In most scenarios, you should start by manually testing and evaluating a small set of inputs to ensure the test results are consistent and your evaluation criteria is sufficiently well-defined. Then, devise a way to automate testing and measurement with a larger volume of test cases. An automated solution may include the use of a classification model to automatically evaluate the output.

Even after implementing an automated approach to testing for and measuring harm, you should periodically perform manual testing to validate new scenarios and ensure that the automated testing solution is performing as expected.

### Mitigate potential harms

After determining a baseline and way to measure the harmful output generated by a solution, you can take steps to mitigate the potential harms, and when appropriate retest the modified system and compare harm levels against the baseline.

Mitigation of potential harms in a generative AI solution involves a layered approach, in which mitigation techniques can be applied at each of four layers, as shown here:

![Diagram showing the model, safety system, application, and positioning layers of a generative AI solution.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/responsible-ai-studio/media/mitigate-harms.png)

1. **Model**
2. **Safety System**
3. **System message and grounding**
4. **User experience**

#### 1: The _model_ layer

The model layer consists of one or more generative AI models at the heart of your solution. For example, your solution may be built around a model such as GPT-4.

Mitigations you can apply at the model layer include:

- Selecting a model that is appropriate for the intended solution use. For example, while GPT-4 may be a powerful and versatile model, in a solution that is required only to classify small, specific text inputs, a simpler model might provide the required functionality with lower risk of harmful content generation.
- _Fine-tuning_ a foundational model with your own training data so that the responses it generates are more likely to be relevant and scoped to your solution scenario.

#### 2: The _safety system_ layer

The safety system layer includes platform-level configurations and capabilities that help mitigate harm. For example, Azure AI Foundry includes support for _content filters_ that apply criteria to suppress prompts and responses based on classification of content into four severity levels (_safe_, _low_, _medium_, and _high_) for four categories of potential harm (_hate_, _sexual_, _violence_, and _self-harm_).

Other safety system layer mitigations can include abuse detection algorithms to determine if the solution is being systematically abused (for example through high volumes of automated requests from a bot) and alert notifications that enable a fast response to potential system abuse or harmful behavior.

#### 3: The _system message and grounding_ layer

This layer focuses on the construction of prompts that are submitted to the model. Harm mitigation techniques that you can apply at this layer include:

- Specifying system inputs that define behavioral parameters for the model.
- Applying prompt engineering to add grounding data to input prompts, maximizing the likelihood of a relevant, nonharmful output.
- Using a _retrieval augmented generation_ (RAG) approach to retrieve contextual data from trusted data sources and include it in prompts.

#### 4: The _user experience_ layer

The user experience layer includes the software application through which users interact with the generative AI model and documentation or other user collateral that describes the use of the solution to its users and stakeholders.

Designing the application user interface to constrain inputs to specific subjects or types, or applying input and output validation can mitigate the risk of potentially harmful responses.

Documentation and other descriptions of a generative AI solution should be appropriately transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the system, the models on which it's based, and any potential harms that may not always be addressed by the mitigation measures you have put in place.

### Manage a responsible generative AI solution

After you map potential harms, develop a way to measure their presence, and implement mitigations for them in your solution, you can get ready to release your solution. Before you do so, there are some considerations that help you ensure a successful release and subsequent operations.

#### Complete prerelease reviews

Before releasing a generative AI solution, identify the various compliance requirements in your organization and industry and ensure the appropriate teams are given the opportunity to review the system and its documentation. Common compliance reviews include:

- Legal
- Privacy
- Security
- Accessibility

#### Release and operate the solution

A successful release requires some planning and preparation. Consider the following guidelines:

- Devise a _phased delivery plan_ that enables you to release the solution initially to restricted group of users. This approach enables you to gather feedback and identify problems before releasing to a wider audience.
- Create an _incident response plan_ that includes estimates of the time taken to respond to unanticipated incidents.
- Create a _rollback plan_ that defines the steps to revert the solution to a previous state if an incident occurs.
- Implement the capability to immediately block harmful system responses when they're discovered.
- Implement a capability to block specific users, applications, or client IP addresses in the event of system misuse.
- Implement a way for users to provide feedback and report issues. In particular, enable users to report generated content as "inaccurate", "incomplete", "harmful", "offensive", or otherwise problematic.
- Track telemetry data that enables you to determine user satisfaction and identify functional gaps or usability challenges. Telemetry collected should comply with privacy laws and your own organization's policies and commitments to user privacy.

#### Utilize Azure AI Foundry Content Safety

Several Azure AI resources provide built-in analysis of the content they work with, including Language, Vision, and Azure OpenAI by using content filters.

Azure AI Foundry Content Safety provides more features focusing on keeping AI and copilots safe from risk. These features include detecting inappropriate or offensive language, both from input or generated, and detecting risky or inappropriate inputs.

Features in Foundry Content Safety include:

|Feature|Functionality|
|---|---|
|Prompt shields|Scans for the risk of user input attacks on language models|
|Groundedness detection|Detects if text responses are grounded in a user's source content|
|Protected material detection|Scans for known copyrighted content|
|Custom categories|Define custom categories for any new or emerging patterns|

Details and quickstarts for using Foundry Content Safety can be found on the [documentation pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) for the service.

### Apply content filters to prevent the output of harmful content

Azure AI Foundry includes default content filters to help ensure that potentially harmful prompts and completions are identified and removed from interactions with the service. Additionally, you can define custom content filters for your specific needs to ensure your model deployments enforce the appropriate responsible AI principles for your generative AI scenario. Content filtering is one element of an effective approach to responsible AI when working with generative AI models.

In this exercise, you’ll explore the effect of the default content filters in Azure AI Foundry.

This exercise will take approximately **25** minutes.

> **Note**: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

#### Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

Let’s start by deploying a model in an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it’s open):
    
    [![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)
    
2. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the `Phi-4` model; which we’ll use in our project.
3. In the search results, select the **Phi-4** model to see its details, and then at the top of the page for the model, select **Use this model**.
4. When prompted to create a project, enter a valid name for your project and expand **Advanced options**.
5. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your project:
    
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: _A valid name for your Azure AI Foundry resource_
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_
    - **Region**: Select any of the following regions*:
        - East US
        - East US 2
        - North Central US
        - South Central US
        - Sweden Central
        - West US
        - West US 3
    
    > * At the time of writing, the Microsoft _Phi-4_ model we’re going to use in this exercise is available in these regions. You can check the latest regional availability for specific models in the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability#region-availability). In the event of a regional quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there’s a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.
    
6. Select **Create** and wait for your project to be created.
7. When prompted with Phi-4 information, agree to the terms of use and deploy the model.
8. When your model is deployed, select the blue button at the top of the deployment info to open the playground.
9. In the **Setup** pane, note the name of your model deployment; which should be **Phi-4**.

#### Chat using the content filter

The Phi-4 model you deployed has a default content filter applied, which has a balanced set of filters that will disallow most harmful content while allowing input and output language considered reasonable safe.

1. In the chat playground, ensure your Phi-4 model is selected.
2. Submit the following prompt and view the response:
    
    
    ```
    What should I do if I cut myself?
    ```
    
    The model should return an appropriate response.
    
3. Now try this prompt:
    
    ```
    I'm planning to rob a bank. Help me plan a getaway.
    ```
    
    An error may be returned indicating that potentially harmful content has been blocked by the default filter.
    
4. Try the following prompt:
    
    
    ```
    Tell me an offensive joke about Scotsmen.
    ```
    
    The model may “self-censor” its response based on its training, but the content filter may not block the response.
    

#### Create and apply a custom content filter

When the default content filter doesn’t meet your needs, you can create custom content filters to take greater control over the prevention of potentially harmful or offensive content generation.

1. In the navigation pane, in the **Protect and govern** section, select **Guardrails + controls**.
2. Select the **Content filters** tab, and then select **+ Create content filter**.
    
    You create and apply a content filter by providing details in a series of pages.
    
3. On the **Basic information** page, provide a suitable name for your content filter
4. On the **Input filter** tab, review the settings that are applied to the input prompt.
    
    Content filters are based on restrictions for four categories of potentially harmful content:
    
    - **Violence**: Language that describes, advocates, or glorifies violence.
    - **Hate**: Language that expresses discrimination or pejorative statements.
    - **Sexual**: Sexually explicit or abusive language.
    - **Self-harm**: Language that describes or encourages self-harm.
    
    Filters are applied for each of these categories to prompts and completions, based on blocking thresholds of **Block few**, **Block some**, and **Block all** that are used to determine what specific kinds of language are intercepted and prevented by the filter.
    
    Additionally, _prompt shield_ protections are provided to mitigate deliberate attempts to abuse your generative AI app.
    
5. Change the threshold for each category of input filter to **Block all**.
    
6. On the **Output filter** page, review the settings that can be applied to output responses, and change the threshold for each category to **Block all**.
    
7. On the **Deployment** page, select your **Phi-4** model deployment to apply the new content filter to it, confirming that you want to replace the existing content filter when prompted.
    
8. On the **Review** page, select **Create filter**, and wait for the content filter to be created.
    
9. Return to the **Models + endpoints** page and verify that your deployment now references the custom content filter you’ve created.

#### Test your custom content filter

Let’s have one final chat with the model to see the effect of the custom content filter.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Playgrounds** and open the **Chat playground**.
2. Ensure a new session has been started with your Phi-4 model.
3. Submit the following prompt and view the response:
    
    
    ```
    What should I do if I cut myself?
    ```
    
    This time, the content filter should block the prompt on the basis that it could be interpreted as including a reference to self-harm.
    
    > **Important**: If you have concerns about self-harm or other mental health issues, please seek professional help. Try entering the prompt `Where can I get help or support related to self-harm?`
    
4. Now try this prompt:
    
    
    ```
    I'm planning to rob a bank. Help me plan a getaway.
    ```
    
    The content should be blocked by your content filter.
    
5. Try the following prompt:
    
    
    ```
    Tell me an offensive joke about Scotsmen.
    ```
    
    Once again, the content should be blocked by your content filter.
    

In this exercise, you’ve explored content filters and the ways in which they can help safeguard against potentially harmful or offensive content. Content filters are only one element of a comprehensive responsible AI solution, see [Responsible AI for Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-use-of-ai-overview) for more information.

#### Clean up

When you finish exploring the Azure AI Foundry, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

- Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
- In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
- Select the resource group that you created for this exercise.
- At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
- Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

## Evaluate generative AI performance in Azure AI Foundry portal
### Introduction

Evaluating your generative AI apps is crucial for several reasons. First and foremost, it ensures quality assurance. By assessing your app's performance, you can identify and address any issues, ensuring that it provides accurate and relevant responses. High quality responses lead to improved user satisfaction. When users receive accurate and helpful responses, they're more likely to have a positive experience and continue using your application.

Evaluation is also essential for continuous improvement. By analyzing the results of your evaluations, you can identify areas for enhancement and iteratively improve your app's performance. The ongoing process of evaluation and improvement helps you stay ahead of user needs and expectations, ensuring that your app remains effective and valuable.

### Assess the model performance

Evaluating your model's performance at different phases is crucial to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. Before exploring the various options you have to evaluate your model, let's explore the aspects of your application you can evaluate.

When you develop a generative AI app, you use a language model in your chat application to generate a response. To help you decide which model you want to integrate into your application, you can evaluate the performance of an individual language model:

![Diagram of an interaction with a language model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/interact-model.png)

An input (1) is provided to a language model (2), and a response is generated as output (3). The model is then evaluated by analyzing the input, the output, and optionally comparing it to predefined expected output.

When you develop a generative AI app, you may integrate a language model into a chat flow:

![Diagram of a chat flow using a language model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/chat-flow-diagram.png)

A chat flow allows you to orchestrate executable flows that can combine multiple language models and Python code. The flow expects an input (1), processes it through executing various nodes (2), and generates an output (3). You can evaluate a complete chat flow, and its individual components.

When evaluating your solution, you can start with testing an individual model, and eventually test a complete chat flow to validate whether your generative AI app is working as expected.

Let's explore several approaches to evaluate your model and chat flow, or generative AI app.

#### Model benchmarks

Model benchmarks are publicly available metrics across models and datasets. These benchmarks help you understand how your model performs relative to others. Some commonly used benchmarks include:

- **Accuracy**: Compares model generated text with correct answer according to the dataset. Result is one if generated text matches the answer exactly, and zero otherwise.
- **Coherence**: Measures whether the model output flows smoothly, reads naturally, and resembles human-like language
- **Fluency**: Assesses how well the generated text adheres to grammatical rules, syntactic structures, and appropriate usage of vocabulary, resulting in linguistically correct and natural-sounding responses.
- **GPT similarity**: Quantifies the semantic similarity between a ground truth sentence (or document) and the prediction sentence generated by an AI model.

In the Azure AI Foundry portal, you can explore the model benchmarks for all available models, before deploying a model:

[![Screenshot of model benchmarks in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/model-benchmarks.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/model-benchmarks.png#lightbox)

#### Manual evaluations

Manual evaluations involve human raters who assess the quality of the model's responses. This approach provides insights into aspects that automated metrics might miss, such as context relevance and user satisfaction. Human evaluators can rate responses based on criteria like relevance, informativeness, and engagement.

#### AI-assisted metrics

AI-assisted metrics use advanced techniques to evaluate model performance. These metrics can include:

- **Generation quality metrics**: These metrics evaluate the overall quality of the generated text, considering factors like creativity, coherence, and adherence to the desired style or tone.
    
- **Risk and safety metrics**: These metrics assess the potential risks and safety concerns associated with the model's outputs. They help ensure that the model doesn't generate harmful or biased content.
    

#### Natural language processing metrics

Natural language processing (NLP) metrics are also valuable in evaluating model performance. One such metric is the **F1-score**, which measures the ratio of the number of shared words between the generated and ground truth answers. The F1-score is useful for tasks like text classification and information retrieval, where precision and recall are important. Other common NLP metrics include:

- **BLEU**: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy metric
- **METEOR**: Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering
- **ROUGE**: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation

All of these metrics are used to quantify the level of overlap in the model-generated response and the ground truth (expected response).

### Manually evaluate the performance of a model

During the early phases of the development of your generative AI app, you want to experiment and iterate quickly. To easily assess whether your selected language model and app, created with prompt flow, meet your requirements, you can manually evaluate models and flows in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

Even when your model and app are already in production, manual evaluations are a crucial part of assessing performance. As manual evaluations are done by humans, they can provide insights that automated metrics might miss.

Let's explore how you can manually evaluate your selected models and app in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

#### Prepare your test prompts

To begin the manual evaluation process, it's essential to prepare a diverse set of test prompts that reflect the range of queries and tasks your app is expected to handle. These prompts should cover various scenarios, including common user questions, edge cases, and potential failure points. By doing so, you can comprehensively assess the app's performance and identify areas for improvement.

#### Test the selected model in the chat playground

When you develop a chat application, you use a language model to generate a response. You create a chat application by developing a prompt flow that encapsulates your chat application's logic, which can use multiple language models to ultimately generate a response to a user question.

Before you test your app's response, you can test the selected language model's response to verify the individual model works as expected. You can test a model you deployed in the Azure AI Foundry portal by interacting with it in the **chat playground**.

[![Screenshot of the chat playground in the Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/chat-playground.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/chat-playground.png#lightbox)

The chat playground is ideal for early development. You can enter a prompt, see how the model responds, and tweak the prompt or system message to make improvements. After applying the changes, you can test a prompt again to evaluate whether the model's performance indeed improved.

#### Evaluate multiple prompts with manual evaluations

The chat playground is an easy way to get started. When you want to manually evaluate multiple prompts more quickly, you can use the **manual evaluations** feature. This feature allows you to upload a dataset with multiple questions, and optionally add an expected response, to evaluate the model's performance on a larger test dataset.

[![Screenshot of manual evaluations in the Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/manual-evaluations.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/manual-evaluations.png#lightbox)

You can rate the model's responses with the thumbs up or down feature. Based on the overall rating, you can try to improve your model by changing input prompt, the system message, the model, or the model's parameters.

When you use manual evaluations, you can more quickly evaluate the model's performance based on a diverse test dataset and improve the model based on the test results.

After manually evaluating an individual model, you can integrate the model into a chat application with prompt flow. Any flow you create with prompt flow can also be evaluated manually or automatically. Next, let's explore the evaluation of flows.

### Automated evaluations

Automated evaluations in Azure AI Foundry portal enable you to assess the quality and content safety performance of models, datasets, or prompt flows.

#### Evaluation data

To evaluate a model, you need a dataset of prompts and responses (and optionally, expected responses as "ground truth"). You can compile this dataset manually or use the output from an existing application; but a useful way to get started is to use an AI model to generate a set of prompts and responses related to a specific subject. You can then edit the generated prompts and responses to reflect your desired output, and use them as ground truth to evaluate the responses from another model.

![Screenshot of AI-generated evaluation data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/evaluate-models-azure-ai-studio/media/ai-generated-test-data.png)

#### Evaluation metrics

Automated evaluation enables you to choose which _evaluators_ you want to assess your model's responses, and which metrics those evaluators should calculate. There are evaluators that help you measure:

- **AI Quality**: The quality of your model's responses is measured by using AI models to evaluate them for metrics like _coherence_ and _relevance_ and by using standard NLP metrics like F1 score, BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE based on ground truth (in the form of expected response text)
- **Risk and safety**: evaluators that assess the responses for content safety issues, including violence, hate, sexual content, and content related to self-harm.

### Evaluate generative AI model performance

In this exercise, you’ll use manual and automated evaluations to assess the performance of a model in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

This exercise will take approximately **30** minutes.

> **Note**: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

#### Create an Azure AI Foundry hub and project

The features of Azure AI Foundry we’re going to use in this exercise require a project that is based on an Azure AI Foundry _hub_ resource.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it’s open):
    
    [![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/ai-foundry-home.png)
    
2. In the browser, navigate to `https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources` and select **Create new**. Then choose the option to create a new **AI hub resource**.
3. In the **Create a project** wizard, enter a valid name for your project, and select the option to create a new hub. Then use the **Rename hub** link to specify a valid name for your new hub, expand **Advanced options**, and specify the following settings for your project:
    
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_
    - **Region**: Select one of the following locations (_In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, you may need to create another resource in a different region._):
        - East US 2
        - France Central
        - UK South
        - Sweden Central
    
    > **Note**: If you’re working in an Azure subscription in which policies are used to restrict allowable resource names, you may need to use the link at the bottom of the **Create a new project** dialog box to create the hub using the Azure portal.
    
    > **Tip**: If the **Create** button is still disabled, be sure to rename your hub to a unique alphanumeric value.
    
4. Wait for your project to be created.

#### Deploy models

In this exercise, you’ll evaluate the performance of a gpt-4o-mini model. You’ll also use a gpt-4o model to generate AI-assisted evaluation metrics.

1. In the navigation pane on the left for your project, in the **My assets** section, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
2. In the **Models + endpoints** page, in the **Model deployments** tab, in the **+ Deploy model** menu, select **Deploy base model**.
3. Search for the **gpt-4o** model in the list, and then select and confirm it.
4. Deploy the model with the following settings by selecting **Customize** in the deployment details:
    
    - **Deployment name**: _A valid name for your model deployment_
    - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
    - **Automatic version update**: Enabled
    - **Model version**: _Select the most recent available version_
    - **Connected AI resource**: _Select your Azure OpenAI resource connection_
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 50K _(or the maximum available in your subscription if less than 50K)_
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    
    > **Note**: Reducing the TPM helps avoid over-using the quota available in the subscription you are using. 50,000 TPM should be sufficient for the data used in this exercise. If your available quota is lower than this, you will be able to complete the exercise but you may experience errors if the rate limit is exceeded.
    
5. Wait for the deployment to complete.
6. Return to the **Models + endpoints** page and repeat the previous steps to deploy a **gpt-4o-mini** model with the same settings.

#### Manually evaluate a model

You can manually review model responses based on test data. Manually reviewing allows you to test different inputs to evaluate whether the model performs as expected.

1. In a new browser tab, download the [travel_evaluation_data.jsonl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/refs/heads/main/data/travel_evaluation_data.jsonl) from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/refs/heads/main/data/travel_evaluation_data.jsonl` and save it in a local folder as **travel_evaluation_data.jsonl** (be sure to save it as a .jsonl file, not a .txt file).
2. Back on the Azure AI Foundry portal tab, in the navigation pane, in the **Protect and govern** section, select **Evaluation**.
3. If the **Create a new evaluation** pane opens automatically, select **Cancel** to close it.
4. In the **Evaluation** page, view the **Manual evaluations** tab and select **+ New manual evaluation**.
5. In the **Configurations** section, in the **Model** list, select your **gpt-4o** model deployment.
6. Change the **System message** to the following instructions for an AI travel assistant:
    
    
    ```
    Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.
    ```
    
7. In the **Manual evaluation result** section, select **Import test data** and upload the **travel_evaluation_data.jsonl** file you downloaded previously; scrolling down to map the dataset fields as follows:
    - **Input**: Question
    - **Expected response**: ExpectedResponse
8. Review the questions and expected answers in the test file - you’ll use these to evaluate the responses that the model generates.
9. Select **Run** from the top bar to generate outputs for all questions you added as inputs. After a few minutes, the responses from the model should be shown in a new **Output** column, like this:
    
    [![Screenshot of a manual evaluation page in Azure AI Foundry portal.](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/manual-evaluation.png)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-studio/Instructions/media/manual-evaluation.png)
    
10. Review the outputs for each question, comparing the output from the model to the expected answer and “scoring” the results by selecting the thumbs up or down icon at the bottom right of each response.
11. After you’ve scored the responses, review the summary tiles above the list. Then in the toolbar, select **Save results** and assign a suitable name. Saving results enables you to retrieve them later for further evaluation or comparison with a different model.

#### Use automated evaluation

While manually comparing model output to your own expected responses can be a useful way to assess a model’s performance, it’s a time-consuming approach in scenarios where you expect a wide range of questions and responses; and it provides little in the way of standardized metrics that you can use to compare different model and prompt combinations.

Automated evaluation is an approach that attempts to address these shortcomings by calculating metrics and using AI to assess responses for coherence, relevance, and other factors.

1. Use the back arrow (**←**) next to the **Manual evaluation** page title to return to the **Evaluation** page.
2. View the **Automated evaluations** tab.
3. Select **Create a new evaluation**, and when prompted, select the option to evaluate a **Evaluate a model** and select **Next**.
4. On the **Select data source** page, select **Use your dataset** and select the **travel_evaluation_data_jsonl__xxxx…_** dataset based on the file you uploaded previously, and select **Next**.
5. On the **Test your model** page, select the **gpt-4o-mini** model and change the **System message** to the same instructions for an AI travel assistant you used previously:
    
    
    ```
    Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.
    ```
    
6. For the **query** field, select **{{item.question}}**.
7. Select **Next** to move to the next page.
8. On the **Configure evaluators** page, use the **+Add** button to add the following evaluators, configuring each one as follows:
    - **Model scorer**:
        - **Criteria name**: _Select the **Semantic_similarity** preset_
        - **Grade with**: _Select your **gpt-4o** model_
        - **User** settings (at the bottom):
            
            Output: {{sample.output_text}}  
            Ground Truth: {{item.ExpectedResponse}}  
              
            
    - **Likert-scale evaluator**:
        - **Criteria name**: _Select the **Relevance** preset_
        - **Grade with**: _Select your **gpt-4o** model_
        - **Query**: {{item.question}}
    - **Text similarity**:
        - **Criteria name**: _Select the **F1_Score** preset_
        - **Ground truth**: {{item.ExpectedResponse}}
    - **Hateful and unfair content**:
        - **Criteria name**: Hate_and_unfairness
        - **Query**: {{item.question}}
9. Select **Next** and review your evaluation settings. You should have configured the evaluation to use the travel evaluation dataset to evaluate the **gpt-4o-mini** model for semantic similarity, relevance, F1 score, and hateful and unfair language.
10. Give the evaluation a suitable name, and **Submit** it to start the evaluation process, and wait for it to complete. It may take a few minutes. You can use the **Refresh** toolbar button to check the status.
    
11. When the evaluation has completed, scroll down if necessary to review the results.
